intro: "Tim Couch, Ty Detmer, Doug Pederson, Spergon Wynn, Kelly Holcomb, Jeff Garcia, Luke McCown, Trent Dilfer, Charlie Frye, Derek Anderson, Brady Quinn, Ken Dorsey, Bruce Gradkowski, Colt McCoy, Jake Delhomme, Seneca Wallace, Brandon Weeden, Thad Lewis, Jason Campbell, Brian Hoyer, Johnny Manziel, Connor Shaw, Josh McCown, Austin Davis, Robert Griffin III and Cody Kessler.	A list this long would be perfect to describe a proud NFL franchise's Hall of Famers, but no, this is the list of starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns since their franchise was reborn in 1998.  Clearly, the Cleveland Browns are cursed with Quarterbacks.  They're looking for the wrong qualities. Here are the reasons I should be the next starting quarterback of the Cleveland Browns."

    <p>It's true, I'm thirty one years old and have never played football on any level, much less the quarterback position, but the Cleveland Browns should know that the following qualities surpass anyone on the above list.  For starters, I have never thrown an interception in my life, much less thrown an incomplete pass.  Also to note is that the offensive line doesn't have to worry about me getting sacked since I've never been sacked before either.  I'm also proud to say I've never suffered a football injury in my life.  I fractured my wrist in the eighth grade, but that was in my non-throwing arm.  Other than that, I've enjoyed a pain free career and that's something the Cleveland Browns have been lacking.</p>
    <p>The Cleveland Browns have clearly been terrible at drafting quarterbacks.  All of their first round selections have been complete failures, from their first pick ever, Tim Couch, to the complete and utter disaster known as Johnny Manziel.  They've passed up plenty of quality quarterbacks, including Russell Wilson, Aaron Rodgers, and of course, Tom Brady.  That's why they shouldn't draft a quarterback at all and settle for an unknown quality free agent like myself.  No more bad draft choices.  No more overpaying for quarterbacks past their prime.  No more old veterans at the end of their career.  Just pick me instead; I'm on a different level.</p>
    <p>Let's also realize another sad fact, no one wants to be the Cleveland Browns quarterback unless they get overpaid.  I, on the other hand, would be willing to take the minimum so Cleveland can use the other money to better build a team.  They have a good offensive-minded coach in Hue Jackson, now they just need to bring in some better players to surround their quarterback stud.  Cleveland needs to take that jump and not spend too much money for less quality.  Cleveland is cursed for a reason, and there's only one person that could save the Cleveland Browns: LeBron James.  But until he has the time to play football as well as basketball, they will need to take a chance on someone else.  That's why I should become the next starting Quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.</p>
