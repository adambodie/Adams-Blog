intro: "Next year, the United States will elect a new president to lead our country.  We have many candidates to choose from.  Unfortunately, politics, campaigns and spending bring out lots of ugly, negative comments, childish bickering and aiming for the lowest common denominator attempts to attract voters.  Not surprisingly, one candidate stands out in this department, a man obsessed with himself, always trying to gain attention by any means necessary, and a firm believer of 'no news is bad new,'  That man of course, is a man famous for building a rich empire and starring in reality TV shows, Donald Trump."

<p>Throughout the summer and into the fall, Donald Trump has consistently said outrageous, negative, racist, slanderous and incredibly false statements.  Firing off many ridiculous statements gets the attention he craves, yet many in the media ask all the wrong questions.  At a rally in Birmingham, Alabama, Donald Trump proudly proclaimed that 'he saw thousands of Arab-Americans in Jersey City, New Jersey cheering after 9/11.'  Many pundits, truth-seekers and commentators have taken the opportunity to argue that Donald Trump's statements are bogus and no one has backed up this claim.  Yet they ignore the obvious.  Why does that even matter at all?  Trump knows this will do nothing to help with National Security.  Talking about the past does nothing to help the future.</p>

<p>The real reason Donald Trump makes comments like this?  To rile up his Anti-Islam voters who want to wage war against all of Islam, of course.  There's no substance in what Trump's saying.  There's no truth in what Trump's saying.  And he knows what he's saying is bullshit.  Trump manipulates his voters by reaching into their hatefulness and gives them a false sense of belief that Trump agrees that Muslims are all 'potential terrorists.'  He spews off 'ideas' that Anti-Islamic voters might like, for example, keeping a database of all Muslims living in the United States, but Trump knows this is unconstitutional, racist and Nazi-inspiring.  Trump is not that stupid, after all, he spent years turning a rich empire to an even more rich empire.  Trump makes these remarks to get attention from his hate-filled voters by getting them to believe that 'Trump cares' or 'Trump can get this done,' despite the fact that Trump can't do much of anything by himself as President of the United States.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has mastered the art of capturing people's negative emotions at the expense of rational thought.  It's what makes us watch shows like 'Keeping Us With The Kardashians' rather than the news.  As long as Donald Trump says something that captures a person's negative emotions about a group they don't like (e.g. African Americans), they won't care about actual facts if presented to them as false.  Recently, Donald Trump re-tweeted an image claiming that African Americans commit almost all gun-related crimes in the United States, suggesting data from the Crime Statistics Bureau of San Francisco.  This will appeal to racist, uneducated voters, who have no issue citing 'black-on-black' crime but thinks nothing of 'white-on-white' crime.  Yet an educated person would take the time to research this and realize that the Crime Statistics Bureau doesn't exist, and further realize the data doesn't match up at all.  None of this matters to the racist voter, and Donald Trump hooks them in by claiming 'he understands.'</p>

<p>Often times, people who are passionate about their political candidate will trust their choice on their issues.  Donald Trump understands this and makes multiple promises that people believe he will achieve.  All politicians promise things they can't achieve, yet Donald Trump takes it a step further by slamming groups of people into the ground while claiming they 'love him' and that he will win their vote.  It's difficult to win the African-American vote when you encourage your voting bloc to 'beat up' Black protesters who protest at your event.  Same with Hispanics, whom Donald Trump has referred to as 'rapists, killers and drug dealers.'  Donald Trump has also made numerous sexist remarks about women yet he claims he'll win the woman vote.  A rational person would question this, as Donald Trump continues to divide voters with negative racist remarks, but gives his voters the impression he's going to win, and has already won.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has treated his campaign like he would with his TV work.  He acts outrageous to gain his viewers (in the political world, his voters), mocks his enemies (getting the attention from the media he desperately needs to be relevant) and gets enough people talking about him so he can try to convince them he's the right guy to choose.  Manipulating your way to the top might work on 'Survivor,' but this is the real-world, and in the world of politics, at some point, Donald Trump is going to have to offer some credible ideas and make an actual attempt to gain votes from the people he considers 'rapists, killers, drug dealers, terrorists, stupid and unattractive'.  As someone who was a registered Democrat during the entire George W. Bush administration, it is difficult to believe he actually believes a word he says, because in reality, he doesn't.  He simply manipulates people into believing he does, no matter how rational the truth really is and how far apart it differs from Donald Trump's 'vision'.  Truth be told, Donald Trump, who's threatened to leave the Republican Party numerous times to run as an Independent, probably self-identifies as a member of the Donald Trump Party, one he's exclusive to and which he's the only member of.  Because in the end, Donald Trump is a fraud who only cares about one person, himself.</p>
