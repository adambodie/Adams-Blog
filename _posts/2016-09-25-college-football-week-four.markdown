intro: "Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football."

    <p>Last year, Minnesota needed overtime to win at Colorado State, as Mitch Leidner led the Golden Gophers to a fourth quarter comeback before ultimately winning the game.  This time around, Minnesota led most of the game and were able to hold off Colorado State, with a 31-24 win, to finish their non-conference schedule 3-0.  Shannon Brooks, the team's leading rusher last year made his season debut after missing the first two games with a foot injury.  The Gophers were able to rush the ball for 243 yards in total, with all four touchdowns on the ground.  Their running game, plus a tough defense, makes the Gophers a tough out for their conference foes.  Also to note, Tai'yon Devers now has three tackles this year, all sacks causing fumbles that the Gophers recovered.  He knocked the crap out of Colorado State QB Collin Hill, knocking his helmet off in the process.  Making the most of his work to say the least.</p>
    <p>Now that the non-conference schedule is over, Minnesota must make improvements in their passing game in order to contend.  They've made strides but need consistency from Leidner and the wide receivers.  The Big Ten West appears to be wide open, with last year's champ Iowa not playing as well as advertised.  They didn't look particularly good against Rutgers, winning 14-7.  Wisconsin and Nebraska look better than projected, with wins between LSU, Michigan State and Oregon between the two teams.  Minnesota realistically needs to win two out of those three matchups to contend, and with Nebraska and Wisconsin on the road, that task becomes tougher.  In the meantime, they need to win their first road game of the season (and first conference game) against Penn State, where the Governors Victory Bell is on the line.  A winnable game by all means but Beaver Stadium is a tough place to play, and Minnesota's only won two games there, the last win in 2003)</p>

        		<h4>Eastern Michigan protesters after the game.</h4>
        </div>    
    <p>Some things are more important than football, and that was clear in last night's game between Eastern Michigan and Wyoming, as protesters, upset with racist graffiti found on campus buildings earlier in the week, took to the field after the game chanting "No Justice, No Peace."  I feel it's important to speak up about issues, and Eastern Michigan University, which supports the protesters rights, should be applauded for listening.  As long as the message isn't lost in translation and no violence comes as a result, this type of action is approved.  Since Colin Kaepernick stopped standing for the National Anthem, it's become a big topic, and unfortunately, those who don't support his actions don't understand what he (and others who have followed) are actually protesting.  That's another topic which I've previously discussed, but Eastern Michigan should be applauded for the way they've handled the response.  Talking about them just gives me an excuse to mention their town, Ypsilanti, which is up there with Kalamazoo as one of the most interesting city names in Michigan (and the United States in general).  It also means I've mentioned each directional Michigan school in just four weeks; Western Michigan, Central Michigan, and now, Eastern Michigan (in that order).</p>

    <p>Oregon opened its conference schedule against Colorado, who's looked a lot better than in years past, but unfortunately for the Buffaloes, their starting quarterback Sefo Liufau is out with an ankle injury.  On the flip side, Royce Freeman didn't play for the Ducks, but they have plenty of talented running backs behind him; Tony Brooks-James, Kani Benoit and Taj Griffin.  The hype before the game were Oregon's new uniforms, featuring green shirts, white pants and orange socks and shoes, to resemble an actual duck.  Hard to believe they never thought of that all these years but it's a nice and clever look, I enjoyed their jerseys.  As for the game itself, Oregon's defense struggled in the first half to stop Colorado's offense, with backup QB Steven Montez looking like a stud in his first start.  Sefo Who?  The Autzen Stadium crowd, along with every Oregon fan watching, was stunned that Colorado led for most of the first half.  But much like the Buffaloes game last week against Michigan, where they similarly jumped out to a big first half lead, the Ducks came back to take the lead late in the third quarter with two turnovers leading to Oregon touchdowns.  But in the end, Colorado won 41-38 as Dakota Prukop threw his first interception of the year at the worst time to seal the loss for Oregon.  Safe to say, their defense is completely broken, as I feared would be the case.  This one will sting, but congrats to Colorado for finally getting a quality Pac-12 conference win, unfortunately it came against the Ducks.  Next up, a road trip to Washington State.</p>

		<h4>Tennessee's Smokey uniforms.  Good or Bad?</h4>
</div>
    <p>Former Baylor President Kenneth Starr said today that former coach Art Briles was treatly unfairly in regards to Baylor's sexual assault scandal.  Regardless of whether that's true or not, Kenneth Starr treated Bill Clinton unfairly for prosecuting the sham Monica Lewinsky scandal which had no effect on the United States, yet felt it was the single most important issue in our country leading to an obviously politically motivated impeachment.  Shame on you, Kenneth Starr --- Tennessee wore their smokey gray uniforms against Florida.  I'm not quite sure if I like them or not, they stand as a complete contrast to their bright orange jerseys.  As for the game, they rallied from a 21-3 deficit to beat Florida 38-28.  Maybe they're better than I thought.  Not Top Ten good, but we'll see.  I've never had any issues with the Tennessee Volunteers, plus I have some family nearby, so I'll give them credit. --- LSU was this close to beating Auburn, with a miracle touchdown, but they didn't get the play off in time.  Classic Les Miles, always poor with clock management.  I can only chuckle. --- With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Louisville</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Clemson</li>
<li>Stanford</li>
<li>Houston</li>
<li>Texas A&M (NR)</li>
<li>Wisconsin (NR)</li>
<li>Washington (-1)</li>
</ol>
