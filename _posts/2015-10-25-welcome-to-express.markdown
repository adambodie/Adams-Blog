intro: "Welcome to Bodie Web Design 2.0, the Express Edition.  As you will see on my web page, I have updated my initial version of Bodie Web Design by using Express as a web framework.  So why use Express (or any web framework) instead of just plain HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.  The answer is simple: It's easier (if you know how to use it)."

<p>Gone are the days of using the same code for each page.  Updating the navbar on each page is a thing of the past.  Now I can have a partial template for the navbar and it will update on each page that contains the navbar partial.  No more days of changing one line of code on multiple pages.  If one thing is changed in the template, it affects everything that uses it.  And using it is as easy as include me (me being the partial layout page).</p>
<p>HTML, easy to learn, annoying to type.  Every opening tag must have a closing tag.  Wouldn't it be easier to translate something into HTML without opening/closing tags?  Enter the world of Jade.  So what is Jade?  Jade is a HTML template language, which converts jade into HTML.  And now, it's a part of my website.  Now only is it useful for following DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles, but it easy to use.  Because in developing, unlike a good Cappuccino, it's good to be dry.</p>
<p>But there's way more to Express than just front-end development.  It also handles back-end processes.  Using the powerful Node.js engine to run a website, it uses many of its functions to keep everything going.  Got many pages to add, just set up a new route to go there.  Want to add Jade?  You can set variables and call them out in your code.  For example, instead of typing in Bodie Web Design millions of times, I dried it up and set a variable equal to it, then called for it in my title tags.  Now I can use with, combine with others, and do whatever I want to it.  Yay!</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it.  Explore the website for yourself.  Check out my Blog page, conveniently set up with minimum code, repeating through like JSON values parsed through HTML.  Check out my front page, project page, you name it.</p>
