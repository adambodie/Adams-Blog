intro: "In an election where Donald Trump has seemingly offended just about everyone that's not an old white Christian, it was only inevitable that Donald Trump would be accused of Anti-Semitism.  With all the Islamophobia Donald Trump keeps spreading, it's hard to forget that the Jews have historically been hated on by the majority of non-Jews.  Recently, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with money in the background and a Star of David symbol proclaiming  'Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.'  Trump took it down two hours later and replaced it with a circle replacing the Jewish Star.  Does this make Donald Trump Anti-Semitic or just plain stupid.  Here are my thoughts on Trump's history of Anti-Semitism."

		<h4>Offended yet?  You shouldn't be...</h4>
</div>
<p>It's true that Donald Trump will say or do anything to get attention.  He'd be the first in line to criticize Jews if he felt he would get a voting advantage from it, just like he does to the Hispanics, Muslims, Blacks, Asians, Millennials, Women, Liberals, Disabled, Presidents, Secretary of State's, Governors, Senators, Congressmen and Congresswomen, Supreme Court Justice's, Catholics, Poor, LGBTers, well, just about everyone that's not white or Christian.  In this respect, it's hard to say whether Donald Trump is a genuine bigot or an acting bigot.  Either way, he's a bigot.  But while all this goes on, Donald Trump has shown a softness for White Supremacists and Dictators across the world.</p>
<p>Donald Trump has always jumped on actions and/or words committed by minorities, whether it's ISIS inspired terrorists like the scoundrel who committed the Orlando and San Bernardino acts, or any black or Hispanic male that shoots and kills someone.  But when it comes to White Supremacists, Donald Trump often agrees with their ideas and retweets them.  Just like he did with that stupid Anti-Semitic Hillary picture.  He's liked their messages before, he showed little anger when being endorsed by the infamous former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke.  But when an undocumented immigrant in Oregon who was deported six times kills a few people, a story that hardly made national news, Donald Trump was screaming about it in anger.  This seemingly Aryan viewpoint of Donald Trump's makes him look Anti-Semitic, but is he really Anti-Semitic?</p>

		<h4>Offended now?  Now that's more offensive.</h4>
</div>
<p>Donald Trump didn't create that image; a White Supremacist did.  But that doesn't stop the picture from being Anti-Semitic.  The loser who made this drawing clearly plays on negative Jewish stereotypes of Jews having money and being corrupt with money.  While it's true that there are other hexagrams (a word Donald Trump is probably too stupid to know what one is) used by other religions; Christians, Hindus, even Muslims; most people would probably identify it as associated with Judaism.  Clearly, Donald Trump was too stupid to see that the image was Anti-Semitic when he posted it, but took it down after receiving criticism.  All in a day's work for someone who claims to be Pro-Israel yet can't recognize an image as being anti-Semitic.</p>
<p>Trump and his idiot associates tried to claim the image was not Anti-Semitic, that the star in question was just an ordinary star or a Sheriff's star badge, but these dweebs fail to recognize that an ordinary star is most commonly associated with having five points, while a Sheriff's star can have anywhere from five to seven points.  Hardly universal for a Sheriff's star.  But what Donald Trump and his idiot associates are clueless to is that the star itself doesn't make it Anti-Semitic, it's the reinforcement of negative stereotypes associated with Jews and money.  He can't change the meaning of a drawing he didn't create.  As my Dad loves to say, "consider the source."  Something Donald Trump never bothers to do.</p>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>This is why Donald Trump would make an absolutely ridiculous claim of Anti-Semitism against Disney for featuring a regular hexagram on a children's book for a children's movie; Frozen, an animated film released in 2013 about a princess who goes on a journey of some sort.  Anyone who thinks that image is offensive is clearly senile and demented.  There are no hidden messages in this book.  It's just a book cover.  This is the definition of an ordinary star, one that mentions "with 50 stickers."  There's nothing slanderous nor racist about stickers from a kid's book made by Disney.  Sorry Donald, that's not a Star of David.  There's nothing Jewish about this.</p>
<p>So is Donald Trump against my religion?  Probably not, but he's stupid and ignorant for not knowing something that's anti-Semitic.  He has a son-in-law who's Jewish, with Jewish grandchildren, so I seriously doubt Trump hates Jewish people.  But not condemning Anti-Semitism and blindly running a campaign for White Supremacists is a sure sign that Donald Trump doesn't love Jewish people either.  To this idiot, it's all about winning by any means necessary.  </p>
