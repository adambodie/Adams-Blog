intro: "After watching seven games of the Golden State-Oklahoma City series, I have come to the conclusion that no matter how talented you are, you need a signature look to gain attention from the common-man.  Sure, Kevin Durant is quite talented, he shoots well and is one of the most feared offensive players in the league, but while I was watching this series, it was Steven Adams and his long hair, long mustache and tattoos that got all my attention, as well as an interesting back-and-forth between my Mom, her boyfriend, my sister and I on whether Adams is good-looking or not."

		<h4>As a youngster, he looked handsome</h4>
	</div>
	<p>Naturally, people are drawn to those that look unlike anyone else.  I was always like that growing up; playing one of my favorite games as a youth in Street Fighter, I always choose Blanka and his green-skinned / orange-hair savage-like looks over the conventional karate master Ryu, who seemed bland and boring to me.  I was always drawn to the different looking characters because they were exotic, unique, out of the blue.  And with Steven Adams, there's definitely something about him that stands out, which otherwise wouldn't happen if he kept his youthful look when he was first drafted.  But is Steven Adams really attractive, or just exotic?</p>

	<p>To some, Steven Adams looks hideous, and though there are some men who look good with long hair, Steven Adams looks unkempt with the beard and mustache when he plays.  I first thought of him looking like (former NBAer) Adam Morrison on crack.  He had the long hair and mustache, but Morrison wasn't the wild-child that Steven Adams was.  Morrison's looks were more goofy, while Adam's looks come off as more fitting.  But playing basketball, it's not about looking handsome on the court.  Players play hard, they sweat and will do anything to get the ball.  It's not like being a model on the catwalk.  Would Steven Adams look good on a catwalk as opposed to the hardwood floor?</p>

		<h4>Steven Adams looks better in official pictures because he's supposed to.</h4>
	</div>		
	<p>His looks personify his performance, so chances are, if Steven Adams wanted to pull that look off on the catwalk, he easily could.  The hair is pulled into a ponytail when he plays, making him look like a warrior of sorts.  But he tends to let his hair loose when he's on the bench, so he can make the look more attractive when needed.  Not to mention he looks happier taking official pictures than when he's on the floor trying to win the game for his team.  A nice looking youngster when he first entered the NBA, the look has evolved in the past three years.  It's that kind of evolution that has some people interested in him and finding him more attractive than your typical player.  For some, who wants to be a typical Steph Curry when you can be wild and crazy looking Steven Adams.</p>

		<h4>Birdman: A man of a thousand looks...and they all look hideous!</h4>
	</div>		
	<p>Some players in the NBA, current or former, have looked exotic and unique but aren't able to pull their look off well.  James Harden, for example, has the beard, which might look passable if not for the equally weird looking hair style.  To me, he looks like a big hairy mess with an unnatural beard, which covers everything past his nose minus the mouth.  Perhaps if he went bald and contained some of his beard near his mouth he would look better, but instead he's the man with the big bushy beard.  Then you have players who look bad on purpose for the sake of attention, like Dennis Rodman, whose hair dye, piercings and tattoos are well-documented.  Another player known for his appearance is Chris Andersen, a.k.a. Birdman, whose body is covered by tattoos and varying hair styles that make him look like a tattoo model than a basketball player.  These are examples of NBA players whose looks don't do them well.</p>

		<h4>The man with the beard...James Harden.  No thanks.</h4>
	</div>	
	<p>Yet for Steven Adams, his young looks make his evolution more appealing.  Unlike Chris Andersen, who looked unimpressive when he was young before the hair and tattoo explosion, Steven Adams comes off more of an evolution of his New Zealander roots than someone who merely just wants tattoos all over his body.  Dennis Rodman's looks made no sense other than being a rebel who wanted to look different, nor did Chris Andersen's, and James Harden's looks doesn't fit his style of play.  But while Steven Adams is not as handsome as Tony Parker, Adams is able to make it work through his roots and playing style.  Adams plays like his looks, and that to me is part of his mystique.</p>
	<p>In all, I would say that exotic looks have the ability to be considered attractive, if done correctly.  It doesn't necessarily apply to all athletes in the NBA, or in sports in general, but in the case of Steven Adams, it's no wonder why there's even a debate on whether he looks good or not.  The simplest test is whether a kid can pull it off, and as in the case of Oklahoma City's youngest viral fan, Lil' Stache Bro, the answer is hell yeah.</p>
