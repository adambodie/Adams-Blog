intro: "Dear America: We have an epidemic occurring through our nation and despite repeated outbreaks, none of our leaders are willing to figure a way to get it done.  In fact, many of them don't think we should do anything at all.  That epidemic of course, is gun violence.  So please America, let's have an honest conversation on how to best handle gun violence and stop with the lies upon lies we keep hearing."

<p>The first thing we must do is to have reasonable expectations.  There is no panacea for gun violence.  No matter what we do, some bad people are going to commit crimes with guns, but that's not an excuse to do nothing but 'send our thoughts and prayers' to those who die by a gun.  Time and time again, congressman complain 'there's nothing we can do about it' and 'nothing would have stopped so and so from committing this horrific crime.'  While this is true, the point of having laws is to try to reduce crime as much as possible.  There is no major law on the book that hasn't been violated.  Murder, rape, robbery, etc.  Just because many people commit these crimes, doesn't mean we shouldn't have them at all on the grounds that 'people will do it regardless of the laws'.  These same congressmen will do anything to shut down Planned Parenthood and make abortion illegal, yet ignore the fact that women who really want an abortion will get one even if illegal.  Clearly these congressmen have an agenda, it's not a matter of believing 'there's nothing we can do to stop gun violence.'</p>

<p>Other congressmen believe in banning assault weapons and other high-powered military styled weapons meant to kill people, not protect themselves.  Is this honestly achievable?  Of course not.  With all the AR-15's, AK-47's and Tech-9's in the world, a better approach is to go after those who shouldn't have them.  There will always be high-powered guns available no matter how hard these congressmen want them not to be, it's best to go after those who shouldn't have them.  Convicted felons love to stockpile on weapons, i.e. gangs, terrorists, psychopaths.</p>

<p>Often times, we talk about background checks and how they can keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them.  Some people believe more tests somehow infringes on the rights of those who own guns, but yet the majority of responsible gun owners will pass background checks with flying colors, so who are these people trying to protect?  Those who shouldn't have a gun: the felons, mentally ill, terrorists, etc.  Do they really believe that we shouldn't have background checks at all, and just sell guns to whoever walks into a store?  There are plenty of loopholes where people can legally buy guns without background checks, like gun shows, and sales through family members.  What makes a gun show different than a store anyway?  Nothing.  And sure, most people who commit mass shootings pass background checks, but not all have.  And stronger background checks that better detect mental health issues could have prevented them from purchasing guns.  Dylann Roof, who shot and killed nine black members of a church in Charleston, should not have been legally allowed to purchase guns despite awaiting trial for drug and trespassing laws. John Russell Rouser, who shot and killed two people and wounded nine in a movie theatre in Lafayette, Louisiana before killing himself despite past legal troubles and documented mental health issues.</p>

<p>Many liberal cities don't allow gun sales in their cities.  Places like Chicago, for example, have tight gun control rules.  But while this sounds like a good idea, it's unrealistic and ineffective at curbing gun violence.  For many who live in these cities, a quick drive to the next town, county or state over will bring a plethora of guns.  There are certainly no restrictions on buying guns in a different town than the one you live.  For this to work, it's either all or nothing, and with honest and responsible people owning guns within their rights, they have the right to buy a gun of their choosing.</p>
<p>For many, mental health is seen as an underlying issue with gun violence.  Murderers like Adam Lanza, James Holmes and Seung-Hui Cho all had documented mental health concerns, yet were able to get a hold of lots of guns.  Yet the very people who claim we need to increase access to mental health treatment are the same people who want to make it more difficult to get access to the insurance they need to seek such care.  Heck, many of our mental health facilities were closed down in the 1980's by Ronald Reagan.  How has that helped our mental health situation?  And each time I hear someone talk about it, they offer no ideas to implement this, instead blaming it all on Obamacare.</p>

<p>Truth be told, many people don't understand the significance of the deadliness of guns.  For Adam Lanza and Chris Harper-Mercer, their mother's were both gun fanatics who encouraged their sons to become immersed in guns, even buying them guns as presents.  Even worse, both of the parents were fully aware that their kids faced some sort of mental illness.  Classic examples of parents not thinking that their mental illness could lead their children to have violent tendencies.  And why is this?  Because these people see guns merely as used for protection and sport.  They never think their kid would use them to kill, but mental illness leads to irrational thoughts which could be violent.</p>

<p>So why can we never have an honest conversation about the best ways to fight gun violence?  Organizations like the NRA simply put money and power over the voices and lives of American people.  The NRA will do anything to remain in power, and make record profits, and do so by lying to the public.  They scare gun owners by telling them every expanded background check, restriction and change of any kind is all about keeping guns out of their hands; that the government wants to make a National Registry so they can start taking away guns from innocent people.  Yet none of this is true, even when congressmen come up with bills that explicitly state 'We're not asking for a National Registry,' the anti-government gun fanatics won't believe it.  The NRA refuses to allow any changes at all, even closing loopholes that allow terrorists on 'No Fly Lists' to buy guns. And yet for all their claims that they care about safety and want to make things better, it never happens.  All they say is 'the laws we already have are fine and we need to enforce them better.'  Obviously, the only people the NRA are really fighting for is terrorists and felons, since they're the only ones affected by the background checks they claim is an infringement on your rights.</p>

<p>It all plays into the NRA's hands.  More guns equals more money for the gun makers, and more power to the NRA.  They suggest more guns, more guns, more guns will stop the violence.  But it never does.  Unless you spend your whole life waiting for someone to shoot you, the shooter will always be more prepared to carry out an attack and have much more arsenal than a person protecting themselves with a handgun.  Anyone with common sense should know that a handgun is nowhere as powerful as high-powered military styled weapons and suicide bombs.  It's no coincidence that every time a major mass shooting is reported, gun sales spike dramatically and the NRA scares people into thinking 'everyone needs more guns'.</p>

<p>There are plenty of reasons we have so much gun violence.  Easy access to guns, people who believe everyone should be required to own a gun, an obsession with violent media, you name it.  Finding a panacea for this will never happen.  Doing nothing will only encourage those to continue committing crimes.  We must find a way to take a common sense approach that satisfies both sides of the spectrum.  It starts with having an honest conversation about guns, mental health and violence.</p>
