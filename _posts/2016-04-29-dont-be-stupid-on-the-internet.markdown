intro: "Last night was the first round of the NFL Draft, a time for the best ranked prospects to join the NFL, a joyous time for those to hear their name called. Yet in this day and age, being stupid sells, and being stupid on the Internet never goes away no matter how hard you try. That's why all the buzz today is around Laremy Tunsil, a highly ranked offensive tackle who ended up falling to the 13th pick to the Miami Dolphins, as someone allegedly hacked into his Twitter account and posted a video of him smoking a bong through a gas mask earlier in the day."

<p>People are going to be stupid, you can't stop that.  But being stupid on the Internet is a big mistake.  Once something gets posted online, it never goes away, it exists in some form of data and will follow you for the rest of your life, like a bad tattoo.  For Laremy Tunsil’s case, his Twitter account was closed just minutes after the video hit the web, yet anyone reading about the NFL Draft or the news in general has already seen an image of said video, knowing it exists.  That never goes away no matter how hard you try.</p>

<p>It's true that people have the right to post things they think are cool, like smoking pot through a bong.  That doesn't mean people should post things like that, especially if it's illegal.  Unfortunately for Tunsil, his Instagram was hacked later that night, posting a cell conversation with an Ole Miss staff member about payments, which as anyone knows, is a major violation in college football.  Tunsil manned up and admitted what he did, but the fallout will be far worse than that, with investigations at Ole Miss likely to start because of this.  Why anyone would ever save a text message talking about rule-breaking is also stupid, as any smart person knows not to leave a trail of any kind.  Digital trails are especially easy to track in this day and age.</p>

<p>This doesn't just apply to athletes and celebrities, who are more likely to be targeted for their fame, but anyone can say something stupid online, often controversial, sometimes illegal suggestions.  Miles away from the NFL Draft, John Martin Ross, a 61 year old man from Medford, Oregon was arrested for threatening President Obama.  Among the evidence found, online rants complaining about Obama and suggesting Obama should be shot and killed.  This dumb gentleman has a right to complain about Obama, but that doesn't mean he should use such strong language.  Anyone can read it and call the cops if violence is implied.   A search warrant to his house led to the discovery of pipe bombs, setting this dumb gentleman up for even more harsh punishment, and as the owner of the words he said online, they can be used against him in the court of law.  Mr. Ross wrote on his Facebook: “I guess you can’t tell the world you hate Obama so much you will shoot him.”  And it’s true, you can’t.  Why?  Because threatening to shoot someone is not only immoral but illegal.  The First Amendment doesn’t protect you from it.</p>

<p>Social media posts tell a lot about people, probably more info than needed.  If you're willing to share your thoughts publicly, anyone can access them, from strangers to employers, so on.  You own your thoughts, and sharing them comes with consequences if not handled properly.  Of course, it comes with great responsibility as well.  Don’t want people to see you smoking a bong but want to show your friends?  Make it private, or better yet, show them in person.  Be smart.  Thinking about harming someone? Only an idiot would share their thoughts with someone else, especially online.  The more that people know, the less successful you'll be at pulling it off.  And it's definitely not the way to get attention.  Texts come at face value, no sarcasm or emotion appears with said text.  So please, next time you want to put something stupid on the Internet, don't do it.  It could cost you dearly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, people like Laremy Tunsil and John Martin Ross are becoming more common these days than not.  These days, news spread like wildfire and anyone can say something that can become viral in seconds.  For people of a certain celebrity like Tunsil, there’s always a price to pay for being famous, and that is that people will find anything against you to humiliate you because of fame and jealousy.  It’s up to them at the end of the day to find a balance between living life freely and avoiding missteps.  As for common people like John Martin Ross, it all comes down to knowing that you’re not invincible.  People often post negative stuff online to avoid physical confrontation with other people, thinking they can’t be caught without a care in the world.  But when stupid people bring up violence, chances are the good people will do the right thing and report you.  Sadly, in these days, when children are learning to swear at younger ages and adults are voting for Presidential candidates who often say derogatory things, social media brings out the worst in people and the stupidest thoughts.  </p>
