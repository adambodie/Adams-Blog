intro: "The regular season has come and gone.  Now it's time to see who makes it to the Super Bowl and win the big game.  Thirty-two teams entered the season with hopes at the title, but now only twelve remain.  Here are my thoughts on the season as it was and my Super Bowl predictions."

    <p>My Minnesota Vikings started off very strong, 5-0 to begin, but after their bye week, the wheels fell off as they finished 8-8 and missed the playoffs.  Obviously, the Vikings, more than any team in the NFL, was plagued with injuries, primarily to the offensive line, which prevented any consistent offense from occurring.  Sam Bradford set an NFL record for the highest completion percentage in a season, but without a sturdy line, his passes were mostly short passes.  A waste from an otherwise good pickup.  Now the big question is, will they keep him or Teddy Bridgewater?  Both are quality NFL starters, and the Vikings can surely get trade value for one of them, but it remains to be seen which quarterback they choose.  Either way, they deserve to fight it out at the very least, assuming Bridgewater completely recovers from his horrific injury, of course.</p>
    <p>Chip Kelly's NFL career is likely over, the 49ers were terrible, finishing 2-14, both wins against the Los Angeles Rams.  Cant say I'm surprised that he didn't work out.  No one could've gotten anything done with that franchise.  Yikes.  But despite Chip's knowledge of the game, he couldn't implement it, and his odd personality is a big clash with the professionals.  --- The L.A. Rams weren't very good either, and finally gave Jeff Fisher the boot.  Hard to believe he was there for so long without any actual production.  Jared Goff needs major work in order to be a quality quarterback.  I was never high on Goff in the first place.  --- I wasn't surprised that the Cardinals were mediocre, Carson Palmer is talented but nearing the end of his career.  David Johnson is a great running back though, and Larry Fitzgerald is a class act as always.</p>

    <p>The Chicago Bears were predictably bad.  Good news for the Bears, Jay Cutler's contract is up; there's no chance he'll return.  Worst contract extension in modern history. --- The Philadelphia Eagles were a better team than advertised, as Carson Wentz has proven himself to be a keeper.  Safe to say they made the right decision to fire Chip Kelly.  --- Washington just missed the playoffs, wasting a good year from Kirk Cousins. Not totally shocked by that one, Washington was lucky to win the NFC East last year.</p>

    <p>Maybe the most disappointing team this year was the Carolina Panthers.  Despite having most of their Super Bowl team back, the Panthers came out the gate slow and never recovered.  Perhaps the rest of the league caught up to Cam Newton, or they figured out that he's not as good when he's complaining about hits.  --- Tampa Bay was a pleasant surprise this year.  Jameis Winston is the first NFL Quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons.  They have a bright future.  --- New Orleans on the other hand, are a big mystery.  Drew Brees is always consistent, but the rest of the team is and has always been a big question mark.  Coach Sean Payton's status is the NFL's biggest suspense coaching wise right now.  He has been there a while, and like Jeff Fisher, has overstayed his welcome.</p>

    <p>The Defending Super Bowl Denver Broncos had the defense, but their offense couldn't keep up this year, which I thought would be a problem, as they missed the playoffs finishing 8-8.  Coach Gary Kubiak retired from health problems, which is unfortunate to hear.  But Trevor Siemian is certainly a better QB than the guy they groomed to replace Peyton Manning (more on that later).  --- San Diego not surprisingly stunk, as they continue to waste Philip Rivers' talents.  Coach Mike McCoy was fired (easy call), and now the big question, will they say in San Diego or move to Los Angeles?  I'd say they should stay, the NFL was without an LA team for 20 years, they don't need two again.</p>

    <p>The least surprising thing to happen in the NFL this year was RGIII's poor performance with Cleveland.  He got hurt the first game and was out most of the season.  It's a damn shame the Redskins ruined his potential, but his NFL starting career is over.  Cleveland was the worst team in the NFL, finishing with one win against the Chargers.  No surprises there.  Another problem is that there's no franchise worthy quarterback to take with the first pick.  Cleveland's screwed  --- Cincinnati finally fell off the proverbial cliff, finishing with a 6-9-1 record.  Marvin Lewis has been there way too long without one playoff win.  The Bengals need to get rid of him, that team lacks discipline.  --- Baltimore had a better season than last year, but still finished 8-8.  They missed their chance to beat Pittsburgh in Week 16, which would've improved their playoff chances dramatically.</p>

    <p>Zero surprise that Jacksonville was not good.  They fired Gus Bradley as their coach after three years, finishing with one of the worst winning percentages during a three year span.  Blake Bortles' time as a starting QB is in serious jeopardy, as he looked like a rookie again.  Not a good sign for three years in the league.  --- The Colts are in serious trouble.  They look like a broken franchise in need of a new direction.  Luck is the only good player they really have, yet they couldn't win a weak division.  --- Tennessee was much improved this year, 9-7 (tied for 1st) but ironically played much worse in their own division than the rest of the teams, as Tennessee managed to beat Green Bay, Denver and Kansas City.  A great second year for Marcus Mariota, despite the injury in week 16.  Gotta love Mariota, congrats to him, here's hoping his career will blossom even more.</p>

    <p>The only thing the New York Jets got right this year was not giving Ryan Fitzpatrick a big extension.  He's a career backup who had one lucky year last season, and played like it this year.  But the Jets are still in need of a quarterback, which won't be easy to find.  --- With even less right than the Jets were the Buffalo Bills, who still reeked of mediocrity and dysfunction.  They were stupid to hire Rex Ryan as coach, and rather quickly after the Jets let him go.  Of course Ryan was fired just before the end of the year.  Ryan is no NFL coach, and Buffalo still needs a quarterback.  Tyrod Taylor is mediocre at best.  Also to note, Reggie Bush finished the year with 12 carries from -3 yards.  All in all from an overhyped player whose best year as a pro was his junior season at USC.</p>

    <p>There were plenty of bad and mediocre teams in the NFL this year, but twelve teams made it to the playoffs.  Some teams are back from last year.  A few teams surprised everyone to make it this year.  So who makes it to the Super Bowl?  Here are my thoughts.</p>

    <p>The best team in the NFC this year, big surprise, was the Dallas Cowboys.  They have dynamic rookie QB-RB combo with Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott, who is clearly the best RB to enter the NFL since Adrian Peterson.  Dallas has a great offensive line to protect the two and a talented defense.  Aside from the last game, where they rested their key players (not Tony Romo, he made his first and only appearance of the season for one series in the game), the Cowboys beat just about everyone.  Except the New York Giants, who enter the playoffs as the 5th seed.  Dallas fans everywhere should be praying the Green Bay Packers beat the Giants, although the Packers may be the hottest team in the NFC after Dallas.</p>

    <p>The other bye team in the NFC is the Atlanta Falcons, who might actually be the sixth best team in the NFC right now.  Sure, they have Matt Ryan and Julio Jones, the best QB-WR combo in the NFL.  But their defense isn't that strong.  I don't see the Falcons being that much of a Super Bowl threat.</p>

    <p>The Seahawks won the NFC West, but their offense doesn't look that particularly strong as it did in years past.  Their defense is carrying them, an understatement to say the least, but are missing key players, i.e. Earl Thomas.  They have a tough challenge in Detroit, where Matthew Stafford has surprisingly played well.  I didn't think he could play without Calvin Johnson but the Lions were a surprise and deserve a pat on the back.</p>  

    <p>The wild card game of the week is obviously the Packers-Giants.  Both teams look like Super Bowl quality teams.  Aaron Rodgers is still one of the best QB's in the game, and Eli Manning plays his best ball in the playoffs (ask Bill Belichick), and with Odell Beckham Jr. having a monster year, this is one matchup that should have everyone glued to their seats.  I picked the Packers to make the Super Bowl to begin the season, and playing at home, they will win a close game against the Giants.  It's a shame Dallas won't be able to play both of these teams this postseason.</p>

    		<h4>Julio Jones</h4>
    </div>
    <p>As for the Seahawks-Lions, the Lions enter the game on a three game losing streak (to the Giants, Cowboys and Packers), but they have been the comeback kids all season, winning most of their games trailing in the third quarter.  But defense wins championships, as my prediction is that Seattle will win this game.</p>

    <p>The AFC is obviously New England's for the taking.  If they don't make it to the Super Bowl, it will be a big surprise, as Tom Brady looks better than ever.  And with a four game suspension served at the beginning of the season, that's four less games of fatigue and bruising hits.  The only concern is missing Rob Gronkowski, but of course, the Patriots are always loaded.  Go figure.</p>

    <p>Kansas City is the second seed, securing a bye, and that's the best news for them, as they have always managed to wind up short in the playoffs.  Andy Reid, great coach, but has never delivered in the postseason.  Alex Smith, good QB, but again, has fallen just short in the postseason.  One thing they have going for them is the rise of exciting rookie Tyreek Hill. They'll be rooting for the Dolphins to beat Pittsburgh so they can face the Houston-Oakland.</p>

    <p>The first Wildcard matchup is between Pittsburgh and Miami.  The Dolphins were a big surprise, I didn't expect them to do much this year, but a great running game led by Jay Ajayi, who came out of nowhere to be one of the best running backs in the NFL.  But they're without Quarterback Ryan Tannehill, who's out with an injury, leaving Matt Moore to start.  Pittsburgh is the better team, and being at home, they'll win this one easy.</p>

    <p>Houston-Oakland could turn out to be the ugliest playoff game for QB performances ever.  David Carr was having an MVP season for Oakland, but he broke his fibula in Week 16, an unfortunate turn of events for a team that could've challenged New England.  Now backup QB Matt McGloin is hurt, which leaves Oakland with rookie Connor Cook starting at quarterback, becoming the first rookie QB to start his first game ever in the playoffs.  The only saving grace for the Raiders is that Houston's QB situation might be even worse, and injuries had nothing to do with it.  Brock Osweiler was the obvious winner of worst free agent signing, as he regressed from whatever potential he showed in Denver.  Backup Tom Savage (who?) isn't much better.  If Osweiler, who will be starting for the Texans, can play some decent ball, the Texans have a short, but Oakland has more talent otherwise, I'll pick them to win a close game.</p>

    <p>For the NFC championship game, I predict a rematch of the NFC championship two seasons ago, the Packers and the Seahawks.  Dallas has played really well, but the Playoffs are a different beast.  Is Dak Prescott the QB of their future?  Absolutely.  He's played like a mix between Tom Brady and Russell Wilson.  That's pretty scary to me.  Ezekiel Elliott led the NFL in rushing as a rookie and it wasn't even close.  Dallas will be a force to reckon with.  But Green Bay is on a mission right now.  There's always the hot team that plays well at the right time and Green Bay is obviously it this year, after a rough midseason performance.  On the other hand, Seattle's defense can easily slow down Matt Ryan-Julio Jones.  The Seahawks beat them earlier this year, they can do it again.</p>

    <p>As for the AFC championship game, I got New England against Pittsburgh.  New England won't have any issue beating Oakland without Derek Carr.  As for Pittsburgh, they're fired up and the Kansas City Chiefs will find some way to lose.  That's why they would love it for the Dolphins to win, but that won't happen.  The Steelers still have Ben Roethlisberger, LeVeon Bell and Antonio Brown.  That's all they need, along with Mike Tomlin coaching, who's definitely not a cheerleader coach (as dumb Terry Bradshaw suggested).</p>

    <p>I predicted New England playing Green Bay in the Super Bowl and I'm still predicting that now.  Maybe Pittsburgh finds a way to beat New England with their offense.  Dallas has played like Super Bowl contenders, and maybe Dak Prescott is the second coming of Jesus Christ.  For all that it's worth, the New York Giants can't be counted out against the Packers.  But I'm sticking with my preseason picks.  All I know is, I'm rooting for the money.</p>
