intro: "Our country has numerous issues that need to be resolved, whether it’s the economy, security or health related issues. Yet some people in North Carolina have apparently found something far more drastic and destructive to our lives; bathrooms, and who can and can’t enter them. To hear North Carolinians talk, it’s no longer safe to go into a restroom without wondering who might sneak up from behind and attack you. You might as well not use public restrooms at all in the state of North Carolina, because suddenly, there has been an increase of men going into women’s restrooms and attacking them, except for the fact, of course, that men aren’t illegally going into women’s restrooms and they’re definitely not attacking them. So why all the hubbub over restrooms?"

<p>The real issue with North Carolinians is that they view transgendered people as diseases, people with mental disorders for thinking they identify with the opposite sex, and that once you’re born, you’re stuck with whatever genitalia you have.  But while these religious bigots see the world as black and white, most people understand the complexity of the world in regards to people.  I don’t understand why anyone would want to identify as the opposite sex, nor is it my place to make that determination.  It’s up to the individual to live as they feel best.  The North Carolina bigots on the other hand, expect them to live as ‘God’ intended them to, no ifs ands or buts.  That's why Governor Pat McCrory and all the other supporters of HB 2, a.k.a. the bathroom bill refer to transgendered as men that want to use women’s bathrooms.  Never an issue with actual men going into women’s restrooms, which is not allowed anyway, but it only became a political issue because their transgendered women.  They are filled with fear and confusion, ignoring the fact that transgendered people are far more likely to be a victim of violence than the perpetrator of violence, especially if they enter the men's restroom.  A transgendered woman is far more likely to be questioned in a men’s restroom than they are in a woman’s restroom, because of their external appearance, not what they keep under their underwear.  They ignore women going into men’s bathrooms, proving that not only are they bigots who hate LGBT folks, but also sexist to boot because they’re target women who identify as men, not the other way around.  People are capable of making their own decisions, that’s not up for the Government to do, nor is it up to them to control our bathroom preferences and bedroom preferences.</p>

<p>The notion that the Government of North Carolina thinks they can regulate public bathroom use is beyond ridiculous.  We have far more important things to worry about, but obviously North Carolinians that support this think there's a crisis in public restrooms, that require constant surveillance, round the clock coverage and national attention in the media so they can gather support in their war on transgender people in the name of safety.  I don’t ever pay attention who’s in the bathroom with me; most people don’t, so chances are, I would probably feel unsafe in a North Carolina public restroom wondering if people would ever think I’m transgendered, because apparently, that’s what people do in North Carolina, observe everyone that comes and goes out of the restroom by checking their genitalia.  That's pretty gay by the way, since 99% of people in any given bathroom are of the same sex.  Thankfully, the state of North Carolina has a Democrat for an Attorney General, Roy Cooper, who has already declared that not only does he not support this nor intends to enforce it, that he refuses to defend it in the oncoming onslaught of lawsuits filed or being filed against the constitutionality of North Carolina’s bathroom patrol.  He’s running for Governor in the state, hopefully he wins over current Governor and wang watcher Pat McCrory.  The last thing they need is a Governor who thinks it’s important to track genitals in the public restrooms.</p>

<p>Religious folks can cry and complain about the changing of times, the accepting of the LGBT community and try everything they can to return to the way things were, but this is not the reality we live in.  They may consider the idea of transgendered people living with the same rights and privileges as us as ‘radical’ or ‘detrimental’ to our society, but the truth is, these people just want power and control.  They live their lives strictly by the Bible, even when they’re contradicting the parts of the Bible which say ‘love thy neighbor as you would love thyself’ or whatever they say by expressing fear and hatred towards the LGBT community and treating them like diseases.  They look at everyone with their gaydar’s up and running, wondering if anyone they come across is gay, lesbian or a transgendered person, and often judge them if they are.  Somehow, they are automatically worse for not following God than these religious folks are, even if they’re following the laws and believe in God themselves.  The religious bigots act pure yet many of them are hypocrites, cheating on their spouses, stealing from others, whatever it may be.  Anyone can be bad, not just those in the LGBT community.  It doesn't matter who I come across walking down the street, I usually just mind my own business.  It’s sad many people are that concerned to bring their homophobic xenophobic hate-filled battle to the bathroom.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise many corporations are against this preposterous measure.  My parent company IBM is among the 80 plus corporations that have pushed to Governor to repeal the law.  And it’s no surprise, because it’s wrong to treat people differently, not only in the business world but in the public world.  Telling a transgendered person they are somehow inferior or dangerous for being the opposite sex of what they identify as sets a bad precedent in the business world, where the consumer is always right, and it fails in the public realm too, where people have the freedom to live their lives as they see fit, rather than have the Government and hateful xenophobes telling them how to live it.  I don’t need people judging me at work, and I don't need it in the public either.  Anyone who thinks this is okay clearly is filled with hate.</p>

<p>I know not all of North Carolina agrees with this bill.  The city of Charlotte was set to protect the LGBT within the workplace and the bathroom, which drove the religious nuts in a frenzy, passing this bill within a mere three hours of discussion, just days before Charlotte was set to protect the LGBT in the workplace.  It’s not a radical idea as they claim; it’s been in effect in Oregon for years and hasn’t affected me at all, nor does it affect any of the anti-LGBT religious nuts trying to discriminate against them.  The sky hasn’t fallen, the world is not on fire and if any transgendered person has been in the same bathroom as me, I likely wouldn’t have noticed, since it’s not on my agenda to keep track of people in the bathroom.  So please North Carolina religious nuts, just move on with your lives.  Take your kids to school and don’t spend your time scoping out the bathrooms.  Do your job and when you need to go to the bathroom, just go to the bathroom.  Don’t be afraid of your surroundings.  This act has gone on too long and is making your otherwise lovely state look ridiculous.</p>
