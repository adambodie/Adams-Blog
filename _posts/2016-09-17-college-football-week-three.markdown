intro: "Week 3, unlike the week before, featured a lot of challenging match-ups, and for the first time ever, the Top 3 ranked teams in the AP poll play on the road against other ranked teams.  Alabama at Ole Miss, Florida State at Louisville and Ohio State at Oklahoma.  Safe to say, champions are made here.  Other plenty of entertaining games abound.  So what happened on Week 3?  Here are my thoughts."

		<h4>Gotta love the Colorado Buffaloes</h4>

<p>The action started early on Saturday, with Lamar Jackson and Louisville hosting Florida State in a Top Ten match-up.  But by halftime, this game was anything but, as Louisville completely obliterated Florida State at home with a 63-20 romp.  Lamar Jackson proved to be the real deal, with five touchdowns (four rushing) against the Seminoles, as they made Florida State look just as bad as Charlotte and Syracuse.  Safe to say Lamar Jackson will now be the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy (with apologies to Christian McCaffrey).  Florida State made an impressive comeback against Ole Miss the first week but Louisville never stopped.  Very impressive.  The only thing I didn't like were their chrome helmets.  Aside from the butterfly on the back to honor hometown legend Muhammad Ali, I didn't like their helmets especially the white logo.  But at the end of the day, Florida State lost ugly, just like they did at the Rose Bowl against Marcus Mariota and the Oregon Ducks.  Ouch!</p>

<p>Another great match-up was Iowa vs. North Dakota State.  It's rare to call an FBS-FCS match-up exciting but as five time defending FCS champs, North Dakota State is not your typical FCS team.  It was certainly a big gamble for them to play at Top 15 team like Iowa, but North Dakota State played like a Big Ten team, pulling off the upset 23-21, with a field goal as time expired to win it.  North Dakota State played a bruising style of game, wearing Iowa out in the end, scoring the last nine points of the game.  North Dakota State became the first FCS team since Eastern Washington upset Oregon State in 2010 to beat a ranked FBS team.   Especially impressive against a team that made the Rose Bowl last year.  I'e always been impressed with the Bison from my time at Minnesota, and they could easily contend in the FBS if they wanted to.  They've won 6 straight against the FBS which says a lot, and they certainly aren't afraid of anybody.</p>

<p>Great match-up for Oregon as they faced Nebraska on the road in their first real test of the year, as well as Dakota Prukop's first challenge as FBS QB.  Before the game, Oregon laid some flowers at the 27 yard line in honor of their late punter Sam Foltz (who wore #27).  Very classy.  Way to go Oregon.  As for the game itself, it was a back and forth battle, but unfortunately, Nebraska won by 3.  Oregon had their chances, and their decision to go for 2 after each touchdown (they went 1-5 overall) was definitely puzzling to say the least, but you win some and lose some.  Oregon certainly plays bold as Mike Riley put it, but those types of missed opportunities along with a lot of penalties tilted the game in Nebraska's favor.  Dakota Prukop played well given the circumstances, but Royce Freeman got hurt on the first drive and didn't come back.  Despite the loss of Freeman, they didn't miss a beat with their running game.  Good game, but not the result Oregon wanted.  Up next, their conference opener against a much improved Colorado team.  Speaking of the Buffaloes...</p>

<p>Michigan played Colorado in a game that would've had no hype if not for the back and forth banter between the two schools.  Jim Harbaugh, hard-ass coach of Michigan with no sense of humor, refused to release his teams depth chart, believing in secrecy.  Colorado, in a humorous attempt to combat Michigan's lack of depth chart, released their own depth chart, with the likes of Elmer Fudd, Austin Powers and The Dude, which can only be described as hilarious and clever.  Possibly the funniest thing I've seen a team do, who cares if Jim Harbaugh found it unfunny.  In fact, their twitter feed as a whole was quite hilarious.  As for the game itself, Colorado played fairly well considering their recent past and playing Michigan at home.  They jumped out to a lead, but Michigan stormed back, winning 45-28.  They're not the joke they were when they entered the Pac-12, and Oregon shouldn't take them lightly.</p>

<p>Penn State did the inappropriate thing and honored Joe Paterno, fifty years after his first game, or forty years after he was first allegedly told that disgraced assistant Jerry Sandusky was molesting little boys.  Coaching aside, Joe Paterno did nothing and many suffered.  Some Penn State fans obsession with honoring Joe Paterno is absolutely sickening. --- Speaking of inappropriate, in last night's match-up between Rice and Baylor, the Rice marching band 'honored' Baylor's recent controversy by forming IX, a reference to Title IX.  Seems Rice is known for parody marches.  They certainly need something since Baylor easily won 38-10 ---  This week, Clemson was on the right side of a boneheaded play as South Carolina State kick returner Ahmaad Harris inexplicably handed the ball to a referee without taking a knee.  Clemson pounced on the ball to score a touchdown.  Clemson won the game 59-0 in a game that was shortened by six minutes as the two agreed to a mercy rule (to shorten said game) --- Alabama finally solved its Ole Miss problem, needing a 21-point comeback to win 48-43.  I hate Nick Saban.  I hate Lane Kiffin.  And now that Steve Sarkisian joined the staff, I hate him too.  --- Western Michigan got paid $210,000 to play Illinois and subsequently won 34-10.  They're 2-0 against the Big Ten this year, that's what I call highway robbery.  Double salute to the departed John Saunders.  --- USC is 1-2 for the first time since Pete Carroll's first year.  Another reason why USC is stupid and pathetic.  Every year it's the same story of what great talent they have all because they're USC.  And they never live up to the expectations and lose.  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State (+2)</li>
<li>Louisville (NR)</li>
<li>Michigan (+1)</li>
<li>Clemson (-2)</li>
<li>Stanford (+1)</li>
<li>Houston (-1)</li>
<li>Michigan State (NR)</li>
<li>Washington (NR)</li>
<li>Florida State (-8)</li>
</ol>
<p>And now as a bonus, in honor of Colorado's fake depth chart, here is my fake depth chart consisting of some of the pathetic people out there, for a team I call "The Basket of Deplorables."  Starring who else but the Republican Presidential Candidate as starting Quarterback, his biggest ass kisser Chris Christie as fullback and handing the ball off to his favorite dictator in Vladimir Putin as running back, you'll be completed disgusted with this depth chart.  Thanks Colorado for the fun.</p>
