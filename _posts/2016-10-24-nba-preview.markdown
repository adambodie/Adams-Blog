intro: "Tomorrow is the beginning of the 2016-2017 NBA Season.  For me, I will have to adjust to life without Kobe.  Who should be my favorite player?  Should I even have a favorite player?  How will the brand new Lakers look.  Who's going to win the NBA Championship this year?  How will Kevin Durant adjust to being the villain in Golden State.  Here are my thoughts."

		<h4>D'Angelo Russell figures to be the top player for the Lakers this year</h4>
</div>

    <p>It's going to be hella bizarre to watch the Lakers play knowing that Kobe isn't going to walk throught that door.  Last year they finished with their worst record ever, a far cry from their glory days they've had plenty of.  Byron Scott is no longer coach, not the right fit for the youngsters now playing.  He especially clashed with D'Angelo Russell, who stands to become the Lakers next star.  Will it lead to wins?  Probably not now, but like the Golden State Warriors at the beginning of Steph Curry's career, they will need time to grow and can at least be fun to watch.  Luke Walton is the right coach for the team, but Laker fans need to be patient.</p>
<p>The rest of the NBA has some entertaining stories.  Here are my standings predictions:</p>
<h3>Western Conference</h3>
<ol reversed>
    <li>Los Angeles Lakers:  The Lakers are still likely to be the worst team in the stacked Western Conference.  They'll win more games this season, but still don't have the talent to compete with the rest of the West.  D'Angelo Russell should be in the running for most improved player and could easily average 20 points per game, but Brandon Ingram, Julius Randle, Jordan Clarkson and company are still too young to showcase consistency.  Signing Luol Deng was a nice locker room deal, perfect to fill the Andre Iguodala role with Golden State, but it's clear they will need to rebuild young: their biggest signing, after all, was Timofey Mozgov (yikes!)</li>
    <li>Sacramento Kings:  The Kings, are and have always been, a big freakin mess.  DeMarcus Cousins isn't getting any happier by the day and their draft picks, asides from him, have been completely baffling.  The Kings will try to hold on tight to keep him, but at some point, they need to realize they aren't going to win with him, at least until they get some quality players around him.  The owners and management have no clue on how to deal with Cousins.</li>
    <li>Denver Nuggets:  Another team without a clue of how to run its team is the Denver Nuggets.  I'm not sure who their best player is.  They have a bunch of young parts, but they don't particularly mesh well together.  Emannuel Mudiay and Jamal Murray are essentially the same type of player, so I'm really uncertain as to the direction Denver is heading.</li>
    <li>Phoenix Suns:  The Suns are similar to the Nuggets, but at least have Eric Bledsoe, provided he can actually stay healthy, is a talented point guard.  That question though, is going to hold Phoenix back for quite a while.</li>
    <li>New Orleans Pelicans:  Anthony Davis is obviously a beast, but he hasn't been consistently healthy, nor has he been consistently been surrounded by quality players.  They got rid of the average shooting guard logjam with Eric Gordon leaving, and Jrue Holiday is out for an extended time as his wife recovers from a brain tumor (hope she makes it), but too many questions about the surrounding talent and Anthony Davis's health.</li>
    <li>Houston Rockets:  It was great to see Houston give Dwight Howard the ultimate "F' you" move by hiring Mike D'Antoni as their head coach, as the Rockets clearly made a mistake signing him, who was bound to clash with James Harden.  But Mike D'Antoni has no business being in the NBA.  He was a mere gimmick back in the Steve Nash days in Phoenix, and his plans to have James Harden as point guard will be a complete disaster.  Houston is a joke.</li>  
    <li>Minnesota Timberwolves: The T'Wolves have a bright future ahead of them.  Karl Anthony Towns has potential to be the next great center, and Andrew Wiggins has plenty of talent, but still needs defensive polish.  Enter Tom Thibodeau, a tough and gritty defensive minded coach to put them to shape.  They have some great pieces to work with, and Kris Dunn has the talent to be the great defensive point guard Thibodeau needs, but in this tough conference, they're still a year or two away.</li>
    <li>Memphis Grizzlies:  The Grizzles have some fine players, led by Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph, but something feels different this year.  New coach, Zach Randolph apparently will come off the bench.  That seems like an odd move for me.  Plus Marc Gasol is coming back from injury.  Mike Conley is a good player but got way too much money.  A lot of these contracts are ridiculous anyhow.</li>

		<h4>Karl-Anthony Towns has the chance to be the next great center</h4>
</div>      
    <li>Utah Jazz: The Jazz have nice players; Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors, Ruby Gobert.  But they lack the star to push them over the top in a tough Western Conference.  Health was an issue for them last year.  In the Eastern Conference, they'd be a Playoff team, but not in the tough west.  It definitely helps to have a great defensive front court, but Gobert and the rest missed a lot of time last year.</li>
    <li>Dallas Mavericks:  Every time I count them out, they always find a way to win.  Much credit to Dirk Nowitzki, one of the all time greats in this era.  His passion for playing and smarts to surround himself with talent makes him great, but unlike Tim Duncan, the Mavs haven't pull in the right pieces.  Harrison Barnes may not be the player Dirk needs.  But as long as he's around, they'll just sneak in to the playoffs.</li>
    <li>Oklahoma City Thunder: Kevin Durant left.  Everyone knows that.  But as long as Russell Westbrook is there to lead the way, Oklahoma City still has a tough team to play.  Acquiring Victor Oladipo for overrated Serge Ibaka could be a steal for the Thunder, and Billy Donovan's toughness will still be around.  They won't be title contenders, but with one more strong piece, they'll be saying 'Kevin Who?'</li>
    <li>Portland Trail Blazers:  The Blazers surprised just about everyone last year, with a great backcourt combo with Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum.  That right there, along with coach Stotts great toughness, will always make Portland tough as long as they stay healthy.  But they lack great size up front to be real title contenders.  Still, Portland is the team no one wants to play.</li>
    <li>Los Angeles Clippers:  As long as they have Chris Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan, the Clippers will always be in the race at the top of the Western Conference.  But as long as the ghost of Donald Sterling is still there, the Clippers will find a way to screw it up.  Chris Paul will be a free agent after this season; this could be the last chance for the Clippers to win with the talent they have and the great coach in Doc Rivers.</li>
    <li>San Antonio Spurs:  Tim Duncan retired, but with the best management ever, along with Gregg Popovich still going strong after twenty years, the Spurs have built a great team for this generation as well, led by Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge.  Add in Pau Gasol to replace Duncan and Tony Parker still around, the Spurs aren't going to go away for a long time.  I could envision Gregg Popovich turning into a robot and still coaching.  It wouldn't shock me.</li>

    		<img src="/img/kevin-durant.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kevin Durant" class="image block img-responsive">
    		<h4>Kevin Durant: From Hero to Villain</h4>
    </div> 
    <li>Golden State Warriors: How does the best team in the Western Conference, who won 73 games in the regular season but blew a repeat manage to come up with Kevin Durant joining them?  It starts with great management and great timing, as Steph Curry's ridiculously bargain extension a few years ago laid the way to build a great team with Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and now Kevin Durant (along with Andre Iguodala).  Considering everything, they didn't give up that much, and certainly have the talent to win the West again.  They won't win 73, but that's one scary lineup to deal with.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Eastern Conference</h3>
    <ol reversed>
        <li>Brooklyn Nets: The Nets are likely to be the worst team in the league this year.  Their main survivor from their failed experiment is injured prone Brook Lopez.  The Nets made some disastrous moves to win now and now their ship has completely sunk as a result.  Unfortunately, the only thing worse than having Mikhail Prokhorov as owner is Vladimir Putin.</li>
        <li>Philadelphia 76ers: The only thing worse than the Nets win-now experiment was the ridiculously ridiculed Sam Hinkie extreme tanking.  The only difference is that now the 76ers have a potential difference maker in Ben Simmons.  Unfortunately, he's injured right now.  Outside of him, they have a messed up roster with Nerlens Noel, Jahlil Okafor and now healthy Joel Embiid in the front court.  Good luck Brett Brown.</li>
        <li>Orlando Magic: The Magic gave up a potential star for Serge Ibaka.  That won't get them anywhere.  They don't have the pieces to get them into the playoffs for a long time, and I'm puzzled as to what the Magic are doing.  Nikola Vucevic is a nice player and perhaps Aaron Gordon will blossom, but despite having Frank Vogel as their coach, Orlando is a mess.</li>
        <li>Miami Heat:  The Heat went from the big two to nothing by putting all their chips in with Hassan Whiteside, a talented defensive player, but not a franchise leader and definitely not worth the extra money that could've allowed them to keep the face of their franchise.  Dwyane Wade is gone, and Chris Bosh isn't likely to play with Miami (or anyone) again with persistent blood clots.  Has Pat Riley finally lost it?  Here's hoping.</li>
        <li>Milwaukee Bucks: The Bucks have some nice young players, but without Khris Middleton, whose meteoric rise to role player to stud, the Bucks still have holes in their game.  Of course, their experiment to have Giannis Antetokounmpo play the point guard could cause nightmares for opposing teams.  But too many questions on the offensive end to put the Bucks in the playoffs.</li>
        <li>Washington Wizards:  The Wizards have a nice backcourt, but John Wall and Bradley Beal recently admitted that their styles clash, and that could be a problem for the Wizards.  They don't have that much surrounding them asides from Marcin Gortat, and now that Scotty Brooks is coaching, who knows how the Wiz will respond.</li>
        <li>New York Knicks: Yes, the Knicks have a case of the Porzinger Fever, and if it still continues, the Knicks have a chance to make some noise, but Derrick Rose, though better than most point guards the Knicks have had, is damaged goods at this point and I don't think Joakim Noah will make much of a difference.  At the end of the day, they'll still be defined by Carmelo Anthony's one dimensional game.</li>

		<h4>It's cooler (and easier) to refer to Giannis Antetokounmpo as "The Greek Freak"</h4>
</div>          
                
        <li>Detroit Pistons:  The Pistons have the talents of an average middling team, and not much has changed for them.  They still have Andre Drummond and Reggie Jackson, but not much else has changed besides that.  Detroit's stuck in neutral unless they bring in some better helping parts.</li>
        <li>Charlotte Hornets: Kemba Walker played really well last year and could take the jump to become a superstar caliber player, but they'll lose out on the inside presence of Al Jefferson, who left for Indiana.  Ironically, Roy Hibbert has taken his place, the classic stiff.  The talent's still there in the backcourt, but Jefferson was underrated.  They should've offered him more to stay.</li>
        <li>Chicago Bulls: The Bulls turned into a complete mess with Fred Hoiberg his first year coaching them, but the shocking signing of Dwyane Wade gives them character, great leadership and the perfect role model for Jimmy Butler.  With that said, I'm not sure how they will work together with Rajon Rondo in the mix as well.  That seems to me to be a bad trio.</li>
        <li>Atlanta Hawks: Mike Budenholzer is a great coach, but Dwight Howard will be by far his toughest challenge, as Howard is still too much of a prima donna to handle, and not the player he was when he reached his prime in Orlando.  The Hawks don't have a star, so they can let Howard take the faux credit, but with Al Horford and Jeff Teague gone, Atlanta is bound to decline.</li>
        <li>Toronto Raptors: Kyle Lowry and DeMar Derozan are still there, and that alone will get them into the playoffs, but not much else has changed.  They were a tad bit lucky last year, but the talent in the east is getting better, while Toronto remained the same.  That won't get them back to the Eastern Conference finals.</li>
        <li>Indiana Pacers:  Paul George is a BEAST, his talent can't be denied, and he came back from the horrific injury even better than before.  Not sure how he did it, but he is one of the better players in the game.  Adding Jeff Teague as point guard and Al Jefferson at center make them a better team.  Still, it's weird to see Nate McMillan as their coach.</li>

		<h4>Paul George is a BEAST</h4>
</div>          
        <li>Boston Celtics: I don't like the Celtics, but Danny Ainge is the best GM around.  His hire of Brad Stevens is the best hire of a first time coach since Gregg Popovich (who's still in San Antonio after twenty years).  Their trade of KG and Paul Pierce gave them a shitload of draft picks at the best time, and their steal of Isaiah Thomas brought them to the next level.  Add Al Horford to the mix, and the Celtics are the best team in the East to knock off LeBron and the Cavs.</li>
        <li>Cleveland Cavaliers:  LeBron James has played in the NBA Finals six years in a row.  That alone makes the defending champs the best team in the league.  Kyrie Irving outplayed Steph Curry and is a better all around player.  Until anyone can beat LeBron in the east, they have to be Number 1.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So who will win the awards, and the title.  Here are my picks:  <strong>Rookie of the Year:</strong> Ben Simmons.  <strong>Defensive Player of the Year:</strong> Kawhi Leonard.  <strong>Sixth Man of the Year:</strong> Andre Iguodala.  <strong>Most Improved Player:</strong> D'Angelo Russell. <strong>Coach of the Year:</strong> Brad Stevens. <strong>MVP:</strong> Russell Westbrook.  <strong>NBA Champions:</strong> Golden State Warriors over Cleveland Cavaliers. </p>
