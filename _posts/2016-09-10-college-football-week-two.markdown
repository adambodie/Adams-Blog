intro: "On paper, Week Two looked to be the worst weekend of college football ever.  No ranked teams facing each other, more ranked teams playing FCS weaklings than fellow Power 5 teams, and just one ranked team on the road, #13 Louisville playing at Syracuse in an ACC Showdown.  But life has plenty of surprises, as Week 2 provided more entertainment than on paper.  Week 3 promises to be better in terms of quality matchups, but here are my thoughts on what happened in Week 2."

<p>As previously mentioned, Louisville had the toughest game scheduled for a ranked team, by virtue of being on the road against Syracuse.  Although Louisville's first two opponents, Marshall and Syracuse, don't exactly bring fear in anyone's eyes, sophomore Quarterback Lamar Jackson has put on quite the show, with 7 passing touchdowns and 6 rushing touchdowns in just two games.  He had 411 passing yards along with 199 rushing yards against Syracuse, putting on a dazzling performance and could very well join the Heisman conversation.  Next week, they play Florida State at home, which would be huge for Lamar Jackson.  A win and great offense production would likely shoot him up to the top of the Heisman conversation.  Louisville also plays Clemson and Houston.  It's too early to but into the hype on Lamar Jackson, but as a sophomore, he's definitely worthy of the talk right now.</p>
<p>Minnesota had a gimme game against FCS Indiana State, and easily won 58-28, which was Minnesota's highest scoring game since 2006 when they dropped 63 against Indiana.  Hard to believe it's been ten years since I was a student at the University of Minnesota; I was at that game.  Time has certainly flown since then.  Not much to say about playing an FCS team, but since Minnesota has struggled against them in years past, a blowout is great to hear.  Speaking of FCS teams, four time defending FCS champion North Dakota State plays next week at Iowa.  That should be an interesting game.  As for Minnesota, they have a bye next week before playing Colorado State.</p>
<p>Oregon played Virginia, who became the first ACC team to set foot in Autzen Stadium.  Virginia is not that good of a football team, but played as well as they could, but Oregon easily won, 44-26.  The offense looked more in sync than last week, as Royce Freeman went wild, rushing for 207 yds, while Dakota Prukop had three touchdowns to three different receivers, including Pharaoh Brown (his first since 2014) and Devon Allen (back from Rio, complete with a hurdle celebration).  Still, their defense has plenty of questions as they gave up quite a few big rushing gains.  Thankfully, the yellow jerseys look a lot better than last week's gray jerseys.  That's a plus.  Up next week, a trip to Nebraska, where of course, they will face former nemesis Mike Riley in a different uniform.  A far more challenging test than Virginia.</p>

<p>Clemson might be #2 in the polls, but didn't play like one against Troy.  Even worse, punt returner Ray-Ray McCloud managed to pull a Kaelin Clay by dropping the ball just short of the end zone.  Thankfully for the Tigers, Troy didn't catch onto this and return it for a touchdown like Oregon did against Utah in that infamous play two years ago. But a 30-24 victory isn't satisfying against Troy. --- Central Michigan completed the best play of the season so far with an incredible Hail Mary and lateral to upset #22 Oklahoma State.  Oklahoma State always manages to wind up on the wrong side of great stories, at least that's the way it seems to me.  Of course, an admitted official error gave the Chippewas of Central Michigan a chance but OK State has no one to blame but themselves for a poor defensive performance.  ---  USC LT Chuma Edoga shoved a ref and got thrown out.  Did he seriously think that wasn't going to happen?  Only at USC, right? --- Northwestern lost again, this time to FCS Illinois State.  Yikes!  --- Pittsburgh Running Back James Conner, back this year after battling Hodgkin's Lymphoma, has played well in his comeback so far.  I'm not sure whose comeback is greater, his or Pharaoh Brown's.  Both are winners in my books.  Congrats to James Conner.  -- Thrilling game between TCU and Arkansas, as TCU came back from a 20-7 deficit to take a 28-20 lead only for Arkansas to get a touchdown in the last minute and a double reverse pass for the two-point conversion, only for KaVontae Turpin (tine) to get a great kickoff return to put TCU in field goal range, which even crazier, got blocked.  Arkansas won 41-38 in Double OT-- Virginia Tech played Tennessee at the Bristol Motor Speedway, setting an FBS record with an attendance of 156,990.  That's a lot of people, I never knew NASCAR had stadiums that held that many people, crazy!  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
