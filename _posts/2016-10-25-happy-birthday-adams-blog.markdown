intro: "Today marks the one year anniversary to my launch of Adam’s Blog.  It's come a long way from its humble roots, going through my major redesign in April.  So to honor my blog, here's a brief history of my blog and how I wound up getting here, along with some of my favorite posts."

<p>I started my blog using JSON through my Express backed main website.   Not the best way to do a blog, but still got me through as I continued to fine tune my developing skills.  Eventually, I made the decision to break off from my Express backed main website and used a Jekyll powered blog branching off my website, which gave me much more flexibility in my blog pages themselves.  I officially relaunched blog.bodiewebdesign.com on May 4th.  I had hoped for a smooth launch, but just before I was ready to move over, the breaking news of degenerate <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/05/03/ted-cruz-the-definition-of-pathetic">Ted Cruz</a> dropping out of the Presidential race, which I had to put a blog about.  I was working on a blog post on him, which I wanted to release afterwards, but needed to post on that disgusting turd.  And special thanks to my sister Jenn for reminding me of that booger pic to use.  Classic.</p>
<p>As you'll see from reading my blog, my two favorite subjects are sports, particularly football and basketball, and unfortunately, politics.  This political cycle has been awful, but has given me an opportunity to express my displeasure in <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/01/31/dumb-and-dumber-why-the-top-republican-presidental-candidates-suck-at-math">Dumb and Dumber</a>, a.k.a. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.  Hopefully that stops after the election.  I hate those two passionately.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Jekyll gave me more flexibility in my posts.  One post I'm particularly proud of is my expose on Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe’s ridiculous theories on <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/05/08/climate-change-and-snow">global warming</a>, as I was able to add a D3 based graph showcasing Snow levels throughout the years to debunk Inhofe's stupid beliefs.  It gave me an opportunity to try a new JavaScript library, which is always fun to do.</p>
<p>As for my blogging skills itself, I feel it has helped me expressed myself through different channels.  I admit, it doesn't come easy for me to speak up, but writing my thoughts allows me to be more elegant and graceful than I have been in a long time.  One particular thing I've enjoyed is my live blogging posts.  <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/basketball/2016/04/13/mamba-day-and-everyones-celebrating">Kobe Bryant's</a> last game and the <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/basketball/2016/06/23/nba-draft-the-future-is-now">NBA Draft</a> were my favorites.  Live blogging the <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/09/26/liar-liar-pant-is-on-fire">first Presidential debate</a>, on the other hand, was a letdown for me.  Some things are better to blog than others.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important blog post I made was <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/08/08/my-pledge">my pledge</a> from August.  It's been two months and I still haven't verbally used that Idiot's name.  It's important to live in a free country and that Idiot is downright pathetic and unpatriotic.  As you'll see, plenty of posts about him and his awful ways.  I'm proud of the commitment I've made and I'm especially proud to have voted for Hillary Clinton this election.</p>
<p>More than anything, my blog gives me another channel to showcase my creativity.  Some of my posts are <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/06/12/three-little-words">serious</a> while others are downright <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2016/10/10/why-i-should-be-the-next-starting-quarterback-of-the-cleveland-browns">silly</a>.  Whatever the case may be, I enjoy my work and am proud of it as well.  Here's to another year of success.</p>
