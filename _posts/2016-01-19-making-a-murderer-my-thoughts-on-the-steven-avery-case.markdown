intro: "Much buzz has surrounded the Netflix film-documentary 'Making a Murderer,' about a Wisconsin man named Steven Avery who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, only to get charged and convicted of murder just two years after his release from prison.  The show and the case has attracted a lot of attention, getting enough votes for a petition on the White House's website to require the White House to answer the petition (F.Y.I. Obama can't pardon Steven Avery as the case was tried in state court, not the federal court).  The big question on everyone's mind, did Steven Avery really kill Teresa Halbach, or did someone frame him for exposing corruption for his false conviction?  Here are my thoughts on the case."

<p>The backstory on how Steven Avery was convicted of rape in 1985 was ridiculous.  It was clear the Manitowoc County Police Department wanted to blame the crime on him no matter whether he did it or not and weren't going to consider any other plausible theories.  They ran wild with that case and wanted him behind bars because they considered him trash.  It certainly wasn't fair to treat someone that way.  And it really isn't fair that the actual perpetrator, Gregory Allen, who they knew about for his past crimes of sexual assault was able to commit more (which he did).  That part of the story is indisputable, as DNA found on the victim cleared him of any wrongdoing in 2003, and concluded Gregory Allen as the real perpetrator.</p>

<p>The real question many wonder is who killed Teresa Halbach?  A 25 year old photographer described with a heart of gold, she took pictures of cars at Avery's workplace, and was one of the last people to see her before she disappeared.  But did he really kill her?  Some of the initial evidence provided seemed 'too good to be true,' like the key they found next to Steven's dresser.  It seems odd to me that if he really did kill Teresa that a key would be left in open view and not disposed of.  That seems a little suspicious, especially when the police department spent 8 days on the property investigating after finding Teresa's car on the property.  8 whole daysâ€¦  That seems too much time to spend at one place.  Anything could've happened during that time.</p>

<p>When they charged Steven's nephew Brendan Dassey for being involved in the murder, the story got even more ridiculous.  The kid was only sixteen years old at the time and seemed too slow and not bright, yet after police interviewed him (without an attorney who wanted him to plead guilty, of course!) they came up with this elaborate story behind the murder, even though the interviewers were feeding him info and asking him questions.  Brendan didn't come out with any information on his own, he was merely answering questions as he thought the police wanted him to.  And what was described made no sense.  Wouldn't slitting someone's throat repeatedly led to physical evidence like blood in the room that allegedly took place?  Not surprisingly, none was found.  They had 8 days on the property, wouldn't they have found blood on any of the searches they did on the property?  And all from some alleged confession of a sixteen year old with a below average IQ and easy to take advantage of.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, Steven Avery was convicted of two of three counts, including first degree murder.  What was interesting about the verdict was that initially seven jurors believed he was not guilty, yet they all changed their minds, three were certain he was guilty and two were undecided.  One juror ended up getting dismissed due to a family emergency, and he didn't believe there was enough evidence to convict Steven Avery.  And Brendan Dassey was convicted on all three counts, some of which were dismissed on Steven's case but not in Brendan's case.  How can he be convicted of rape, yet they dropped the charge from Steven's case even though he was the 'ringleader,' or of mutilating a corpse, which Steven was found not guilty of.  It makes no sense to me.</p>

<p>Is it possible that there's no conspiracy and that Steven Avery really did kill Teresa Halbach?  It could have happened, but we really don't know what actually happened.  Perhaps it was an accident.  Maybe Teresa said something to Steven that made him lose his temper and kill her.  Those things could've happened, but in the legal world, you need solid evidence of a crime happening in order to convict.  The evidence presented in the case was circumstantial at best.  No DNA of Teresa in the trailer, no blood of hers in the trailer or garage, no complete body or cause of death.  Just a few spots of Steven's blood in the RAV4.  It's possible the police planted evidence to prove Steven did it, even though Steven could have very well done it, there may have been no proof he did it.  You can never rule that out.  Based on the documentary, it doesn't seem Steven would kill Teresa, but then again, everyone has that other side that they don't want you to find out.  The side that made Steven snap in 1985 and forced his cousin off the road to confront her about rumors she spread.  There's always that possibility as well, we really don't know or probably find out.</p>

<p>Since it is a documentary, it paints a picture that Steven is innocent because he was falsely accused of rape in 1985, spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit and sued the Manitowoc County police department for targeting him when they had another suspect (the real suspect) that they never pursued.  Now that the documentary has been released, Special Prosecutor Ken Kratz, who led the fight against Steven Avery at the Halbach trial, now says that additional evidence was left out of the show completely.  There's so much stuff mentioned in the trial, they couldn't include it all.  Not surprisingly, none of the evidence 'left out' would make Steven guilty on its own.  Calling Teresa's business the day she showed up doesn't prove anything, nor does the structure of the dresser with the key.  And while DNA on the RAV4 may sound special, it is really reliable?  And prison hearsay of Steven Avery talking about torturing women in torture chambers.  That was the most ridiculous thing said.  It wasn't even used in the trial because it was unreliable, just like all prison snitches making ridiculous statements.</p>

<p>Based on everything I have read on the case, I would not have convicted Steven Avery or Brendan Dassey.  Though I can't say for certain if Steven is innocent, if you can't prove he committed a crime, then he should have been found not guilty.  There is no strong evidence proving Steven killed Teresa.  It's all circumstantial at best.  And the Manitowoc County Police Department tainted the investigation by getting involved when it wasn't supposed to.  It's possible they planted evidence, but it's possible they didn't.  The big question is, why would someone kill an innocent woman just to frame someone?  Teresa Halbach didn't deserve to die, and I have a hard time believing the police would kill her just to punish Steven Avery.  As for Brendan Dassey, he got screwed by the system.  I don't believe he did anything wrong, they just targeted him for being seen with Steven the night Teresa disappeared and because he's not very smart.  His first defense attorney openly worked with prosecution to get him to plead guilty for something he didn't do.  His 'confession' was made under pressure and probably coerced by the police.  They knew they could take advantage of him.</p>

<p>As of now, Steven Avery's case has been taken over by high-powered defense attorney Kathleen Zellner, who won exonerations for 17 wrongfully convicted criminals.  An appeal has been filed, claiming the police searched his place without a valid warrant, and also claiming a juror pressured other jurors to convict him.  Whether any of this helps Steven Avery will remain to be seen.  As time goes on, technology gets more powerful and can make it easier to prove guilt or innocence in a crime.  Down the road, better testing can better prove if EDTA was in the blood sample in the RAV4.  Perhaps the bones they found can produce better evidence to tie or not tie Steven to the case.  But Steven has spent too much time in prison, first for a crime he didn't commit, and now for a crime he may or may not have committed.  As someone who likes conclusive evidence, I believe Steven should be released from prison, because at the end of the day, the only people who really know what happened is Steven Avery and Teresa Halbach.  No one else knows for certain who committed the crime, and if people like Casey Anthony, George Zimmerman and O.J. Simpson are given the benefit of the doubt, why not Steven Avery.  Innocent until PROVEN guilty, emphasis on the word proven.</p>
