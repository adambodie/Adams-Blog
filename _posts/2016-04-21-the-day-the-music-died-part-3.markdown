intro: "When people refer to “The Day the Music Died,” they are referring to the tragic death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper when they perished in a plane crash outside of Clear Lake, Iowa on February 3, 1959. Yet years later, we’ve lost many musicians with a far bigger influence. With apologies to Elvis Presley, John Lennon, everyone in the “27 Club” (Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and more recently, Amy Winehouse), we’ve seen two deaths in the music world truly crushing since that day. The second was of course, Michael Jackson’s tragic death on June 25, 2009, and the third was today, as Prince passed away."

<p>For those who have followed Prince’s music, know him as the definition of eclectic, reaching all aisles of the music spectrum blended perfectly to a sound known simply as the ‘Minneapolis Sound.’  Whether it was rock, R&amp;B, pop, whatever it was, Prince knew just how to make the perfect harmony with a mesh of styles.  As a music enthusiast and a well-known perfectionist, Prince was and is the defining artist for those aiming to reach all aisles of the map.  Many artists today, including Andre 3000 from Outkast and Janelle Monae are often compared to Prince for their various stylings of music.  But none of them can be Prince.</p>

<p>Prince also had an extreme flair for fashion and performances, well known for his overtly sexually charged performances and somewhat raunchy live-shows.  But yet Prince always knew the appropriate way to reach his platform.  His performance at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2007 was the best performance I’ve ever seen.  Many others including Billboard Magazine agree, as Prince showcased his electric styling of his songs and covers of other songs, which concluded with Purple Pain while it was actually raining, creating the perfect purple glow from the lighting.  But Prince also had more intimate surprise shows perfect for the smaller crowd.  Prince had everything covered when it came to performance.</p>

<p>The first song I ever purchased on iTunes was ‘When Doves Cry,’ a classic example of Prince’s Minneapolis Sound and one of his biggest hits, from the album that pushed him to superstardom, Purple Rain.  A soundtrack of a movie of the same name starring Prince as ‘The Kid,’ though I thought the movie was somewhat corny, based somewhat on his life, it’s the music that people most remember about Prince.  Though Prince’s acting career didn’t last too long, his music never stopped, spanning from 1978 till today, featuring classic hits including ‘When Doves Cry,’ ‘Purple Rain,’ ‘1999,’ ‘Raspberry Beret’ and many more.</p>

<p>Another one of Prince’s well-known qualities was his quest for musician ownership rights and creative freedom.  He famously squabbled with his record label Warner Bros. for ownership and control of his music, changing his name to an unpronounceable symbol (people referred to him as ‘The Artist formerly known as Prince’).  To many, Prince was an idol in the music industry for standing up to his bosses and demanding creativity and freedom.  Of course, the flip side of this was that Prince did everything he could to keep his music off the Internet, demanding fansites taken down and performances removed from sites like youTube as Prince wanted compensation for his works.</p>

<p>Yet despite all of this, virtually everyone is saddened by Prince’s passing.  From musicians, entertainers, athletes and even the politicians, chances are people right now are sad to see Prince go, probably listening to his past hits, wondering what the heck happened.  I always considered it my dream Halloween costume to dress up like Prince, complete with the purple suit, guitar and wild hair.  That would have been the dream for me, but I could never pull it off, sadly.  It would have been mind-blowing.  As an adopted Minnesotan, having gone to school at the University of Minnesota, I remember seeing First Avenue, driving by Paisley Park in Chanhassen, all while blasting his music.  He will be missed.  Heaven just got a lot funkier.</p>
