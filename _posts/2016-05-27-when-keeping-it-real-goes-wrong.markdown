intro: "Anyone who used to watch Chappelle's Show back in the day surely remembers the skit, 'When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong,' as Dave Chappelle's comically showed skits of so-called thugs and gangstas in instances when it's not the best idea to 'keep it real.'  But that was 2003, now in the days of social media, viral videos and tweets, it often shows that way too many people 'keep it real' when they shouldn't.  A sad but unfortunate side effect of stupidity."

		<h4>Troy Ave may think it's fine to keep it real</h4>
</div>
	<p>Case in point, the recent shooting at New York's Irving Plaza before a T.I. show, where Brooklyn rapper Troy Ave, a gangsta rapper who leads the BSB crew, got into a seemingly random argument with allegedly another crew.  A street smart rapper would find a better time to take revenge, definitely not in a public place.  Instead, Troy Ave, losing his cool and keeping it real, started firing shots.  Even worse, he was caught on camera firing shots, a definite no-no for someone who, like a lot of criminals, can't legally own a gun.  Now everyone who knows what he looks like can watch the grainy video seeing Troy Ave looking for someone, firing shots and leaving the view.  And the worst of it all, Troy Ave's bodyguard, Banga, was the only fatality.  So while Troy Ave, seemingly on his way to the top, finds himself charged with Attempted Murder, Reckless Endangerment and Criminal Possession of a Weapon, and a fresh wound in the leg for shooting himself.</p>

		<h4>But it can take just seconds to pull up this image of the shooting.</h4>
	</div>
	<p>This might have not been a big deal in 2003, but now, it can only take seconds for someone to screw up and have everyone find out.  Troy Ave, whose album Major Without A Deal sold a lousy 2,000 copies in his first week, must've thought that street cred is the way to fame, but many rappers have been able to maintain their street cred without acting callously on camera.  So while people now know his name more than before, keeping it real likely has him locked him up behind bars for what fame he has gained.</p>

	<p>But you don't have to commit violent crimes to 'keep it real.'  Just ask Azealia Banks, a female rapper who instead of making music (allegedly her contract won't let her), makes her rounds by constantly arguing with other rappers, celebrities and all of mankind on Twitter.  Some may think it's cool to talk trash about others, but there's a big difference between personal conversations and social media posts, which even deleted within seconds, will last a lifetime.  Azealia Banks, thinking it's cool to talk trash about others with foul language, has managed to offend almost everyone by 'keeping it real.'  Yet strongly homophobic comments about singer Zayn Malik and twitter attacks on 14 year old actress Skai Jackson led to people standing up to her, as Azealia Banks was banned from Twitter for engaging in such foul and harsh language.</p>
	<p>And yet people would constantly mouth off and say the wrong thing back in the days.  But with social media out there, it's easier to know when people are saying stupid shit.  It's easier for people to show off and try to 'keep it real,' as if they'll get more fans from it, but has Azealia Banks really accomplished anything?  I still don't know one song of hers, so whenever I hear about her, it's for the wrong reasons and not what she's supposed to be doing with her life.  So has 'keeping it real' lead to any album sales?  Not really.</p>

		<h4>Most people who know Azealia Banks associate her with bad Twitter behavior.</h4>
</div>
	<p>Plenty of people love to keep it real, even with a stunning lack of consequences for doing so.  It's as if people are totally forgetting about the consequences of their actions.  With social media a constant in our lives now, people are able to keep it real for the whole world to see, even if they don't intend everyone to see it.  Living in a world where anything that's shot on camera will make its way to the internet within hours or any tweet you make, no matter how much you regret it, will never go away.  </p>
