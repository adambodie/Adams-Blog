intro: "Week Seven for me is Strange Week.  The Minnesota Golden Gophers make their way to Maryland to play them for the first time since they joined the Big Ten in 2014.  I'm still not used to them and Rutgers being part of the Big Ten.  Maryland should've remained in the ACC and Rutgers looks like complete crap.  Market aside, the Big Ten should've stopped with Nebraska.  But nonetheless, it's the game against the Terrapins.  As for the Ducks, they stand to have their best defensive performance of the season, as they have the week off.  As for the rest of the week, it seems kind of bland, with the exception of Alabama-Tennessee and Ohio State-Wisconsin."

    <p>The Gophers faced off against Maryland with their first glimpse into the future.  Mitch Leidner was out with a concussion, so backup QB Conor Rhoda gets his first start.  He's a junior so we'll see who the starter is next season, but here's hoping Mitch Leidner will be back for next weeks game, not that they need him against god-awful Rutgers.  As long as they have the Rodney Smith-Shannon Brooks combo at Running Back, Minnesota will be just fine.  And that was true for the Gophers first Big Ten matchup against Maryland.  Their defense shut down Maryland's offense, holding them scoreless through three quarters, and the Gophers mostly kept it on the ground, with their dynamic duo that they've missed since the great Marion Barber III-Laurence Maroney days.  Their defense forced four turnovers against Maryland, including a pick-six by Antoine Winfield Jr. to seal the game.  Minnesota got the win they really needed, 31-10.  Next up, their homecoming game against god-awful Rutgers.</p>
    <p>This week wasn't particularly interesting, and honestly, I wasn't really paying that much attention to it. I had other things to do. --- Tennessee got their butts wooped by Alabama, no surprise there. --- Ohio State beat Wisconsin in overtime.  So much for Wisconsin having a down year, although their wins against LSU and Michigan State look far less impressive than they did at the time.  LSU fired Les Miles and Michigan State is 2-4. --- Clemson barely survived against NC State, as NC State missed a field goal that would've won the game at the end of the fourth quarter.  --- Oregon plays Cal next Friday at Cal.  They'll probably give up a touchdown before the game starts. ---  That's all I got for now, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Michigan (+1)</li>
<li>Clemson (-1)</li>
<li>Washington (+1)</li>
<li>Louisville (-1)</li>
<li>Texas A&M</li>
<li>Nebraska (+1)</li>
<li>Wisconsin (-1)</li>
<li>Baylor</li>
</ol>
