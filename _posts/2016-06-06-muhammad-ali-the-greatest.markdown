intro: "On Friday night, late in the evening, I found out that Muhammad Ali, the legendary boxer, had passed away at the age of 74.  Though I'm not a boxing fan and I don't know any boxing fans, there was always one boxer that everyone knew about, Mr. Muhammad Ali.  Though some would argue that Mike Tyson is equally famous, he was known for the wrong reasons.  But Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest, as he frequently claimed, but he was the most important athlete of the 20th Century in any sport."

<p>It was only seventeen years prior in 1947 that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the biggest sport at the time, baseball, becoming an American hero at a time when blacks were still segregated in some parts of the country.  Back then, African-Americans were just starting to participate in professional sports with the white majority.  The Civil Rights act didn't pass until 1965, so at a time when the African American community needed a powerful voice, in entered Muhammad Ali, who first became popular in 1964 after an upset of Heavyweight Champion of the time, Sonny Liston.  But unlike the African American athletes of the past, Muhammad Ali, then known by his birth name Cassius Clay, was not afraid of anyone.  He said what he felt, and was confident in what he said, the type of swagger that was missing from the African American community in sports at the time.</p>
<p>When the former Cassius Clay changed his name to Muhammad Ali and converted to Islam shortly after beating Sonny Liston, he did not care what others thought of him, he did what he felt was right for him, and wasn't afraid to let people know.  He stood up for those afraid to speak out their minds and did so with such an incredible sense of confidence and proudness.  For many, Muhammad Ali was the voice of a community just starting to gain basic rights they previously didn't have, as the Civil Rights act passed the following year.  Obviously, there were men like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, but Ali, being a sports figure, didn't have to do the things he did, which made his voice different from those whose main objective in life was to fight for African American rights.</p>

		<h4>Muhammad Ali: The Champ</h4>
</div>
<p>Muhammad Ali was the greatest boxer at the time, and still is seen today as the greatest by many; the skill set he displayed pushed him to the top.  But his fearlessness outside the boxing ring made him the legendary figure he is known for today.  With the Vietnam War brewing, Ali was drafted to fight in the war.  But Ali stood his ground, proclaiming he objected to serving, citing his religious beliefs.  He stood up for what he truly believed in, sacrificing everything while fighting charges for draft evasion.  There were plenty of people who despised him for not answering the draft call, claiming him 'un-American' for not serving his country when they needed him, but Ali, in his own words, 'had no reason to fight the Viet-cong.'  While many athletes, even those today are too afraid to suffer the consequences for standing up to causes, Ali did not flinch, and though he wasn't able to fight from 1968-1971 as he fought the charges, he did so believing in what he believed in, while losing his championship titles in the process.  Most athletes wouldn't sacrifice the money lost and reputation suffered for taking a stand but Ali wasn't afraid of this.</p>
<p>Ali returned to the ring in 1971, and although he wasn't as youthful as before, he still had the skill to be the champ, despite the younger blood out to get him.  Though he lost a big fight to Joe Frazier, a boxer whom would become Ali's biggest rival, people still loved Ali's attitude and skill, rooting for him to be the champ once again.  He became worldwide known in the process, with two of his biggest fights in his career happening overseas.  First was the 'Rumble in the Jungle' against George Foreman in 1975 in what was known as Kinshasa, Zaire.  While there, he embraced the culture of those in the former Zaire, becoming a hero in the process.  He defeated then champion George Foreman in what was considered the biggest fight at the time, as many considered George Foreman the hardest hitting boxer around.</p>

	<p>The other big fight took place the following year in his third and final fight against Joe Frazier, arguably his biggest rival.  Smokin' Joe Frazier beat him the first match, but Ali beat him the second match.  As such, they agreed to fight on more time, in Manila, Philippines, in a fight known as 'The Thrilla in Manila.'  Ali, the master trash talker, got into Frazier's head with his jaunts, and Ali won the match.</p>
	<p>Ali was not the same fighter after that, as his age started to show and in part to all the hits he took, began showing signs of Parkinson's disease, which he was officially diagnosed with in 1984, after his retirement in 1981.  But despite all of this, Ali was still beloved by many and an inspiration to those not willing to speak up.  He fought for his beliefs, had a strong sense of religion without judging others for theirs, and knew exactly how to entertain people.  Many of those who needed a voice got an empowering voice from Ali.  It's no wonder that he carried the torch for us in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta; no one else deserved such a higher honor in our Olympics.</p>

	<p>In a time where Muslims are often chastised for those who commit acts of terrorism, Muhammad Ali stood up for real Islam, proclaiming the radical terrorists as inauthentic and not true believers of Islam.  Perhaps the most famous Muslim living, Muhammad Ali continued to profess his beliefs in Islam, even as some people attacked Islam and associating Islam with terrorism.  Ali knew better and spoke the truth, unapologetic and unafraid to do so.  So while some people may treat good Muslims bad, there was Ali standing up for the millions of Muslims who needed a strong voice.</p>
	<p>So when I heard Muhammad Ali has passed away, I was sad like many.  He was the greatest boxer, but even more important, the greatest sports humanitarian of his time.  As I've seen many times, from 9/11 to the Boston Marathon Bombing, sports, more than anything, can bond people together like nothing else, heal people in a time of need and make people proud of their country.  Muhammad Ali, more than any athlete, embodied that notion, never wavering on his beliefs, speaking up for those who didn't have a voice while achieving greatness within his sport.  So while other famous athletes like Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods wouldn't speak up on social issues to preserve their financial and personal reputation, Ali was more than eager to speak his mind when he felt was right.  That, more than anything, made Ali the Greatest.  R.I.P. to a real legend in every sense of the word.</p>
