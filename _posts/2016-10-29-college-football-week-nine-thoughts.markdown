intro: "Week Nine featured two decent matchups on my end.  For the Gophers, it was the week to clinch bowl eligibility.  For Oregon, it was another week to end their hideous skid.  How did Week Nine play out?  Read here for my thoughts."

    <p>Two seasons ago, when Minnesota made its first New Year's Day bowl since 1962, the Gophers were upset by Illinois, a lowlight for that season.  This year, the Gophers needed not to repeat that game.  And thankfully, the banged-up Fighting Illini were no match for the Gophers ground game and their defense shined.  Illinois had two key turnovers in the first half leading to both Minnesota touchdowns as the Gophers easily won 40-17. Illinois was down to their third-string freshman QB Jeff George Jr. (son of infamous NFL QB Jeff George).  Their top receiver, Malik Turner got hurt in the first quarter from an unfortunate hit from safety Duke McGhee, who was ejected for targeting.  With a particular windy day, the Gophers ground game made it easy for them, as the Gophers are now bowl eligible at 6-2.  But the season's not over and they still have a shot at the Big Ten West title, which definitely won't come easy with their last three games against Nebraska, Northwestern and Wisconsin.  Next up, Purdue.</p>
    <p>Oregon desparately needed a win against Arizona State, whom Oregon went through drastic measures to keep the Sun Devils from stealing their signs (much like Washington State did against them last week).  Also notable were Arizona States "Desert Chrome" uniforms, which look stylish, much different from their same-color-scheme-as-Minnesota's jerseys.  Thankfully, the Ducks finally won a game, their first Pac-12 win of the season, winning 54-35.  One thing for certain is that Justin Herbert, despite looking like a thirteen year old (he's 18, a true freshman) is legit.  His shocking meteoric rise from afterthought to being the first true freshman to start for the Ducks since Chris Miller in 1983 is quite astonishing considering he wasn't highly recruited, and from nearby Sheldon High School, a hometown kid.  What's not to love about Justin Herbert.  He threw for 489 passing yards today (tying a team record with Bill Musgrave) with 4 touchdowns.  Impressive, especially as a true freshman.  Hopefully, the Ducks will turn around their season now, but it won't be easy.  Next up, the worst school in the country, the University of Spoiled Cheaters.  God I hate them so much!</p>
    <p>The Big XII's playoff chances took a huge hit today as West Virginia lost at Oklahoma State.  Their chances were slim to begin with, but at this point, the Big XII is going to need help to get back into the Playoffs.  Even worse was the fact that Baylor lost as well, being upset by Texas in the last minute 35-34.  I'm glad Baylor lost, especially with all the sexual assaults Art Briles ignored as coach, recent reports indicate he failed to report at least one sexual assault case he knew about.  And he claims he didn't deserve to be fired.  Yes he did!  But at this point, Oklahoma is the only unbeaten Big XII team in conference play, but with two non-conference losses against Ohio State and Houston (who lost last week to SMU of all teams), that makes their challenge more daunting.  As I'm obligated to include one Big XII team, I'm not ready to eliminate Baylor from my list.  But it's a long shot.  Nebraska also lost for the first time this season against Wisconsin, who, you can never count out.  With that said, they need to make it to the Big Ten title game to be considered for a playoff berth.  That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Ohio State, Texas A&M, Louisville, Nebraska, Baylor, and Florida.</p>

    <p>Washington finally faced a significant test as they visited Utah in a hard fought 31-24 victory, with Washington winning the game on a punt return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.  If Lamar Jackson doesn't win the Heisman Trophy for some reason, Washington QB Jake Browning should win it.  He's been quite good this season for the Huskies.  I still don't like the Huskies but the Pac-12 needs someone in the Playoffs and they're the only hope at this point.  I'd rather see them in then two SEC teams, to say the least. --- Speaking of Lamar Jackson, Louisville needed a last-minute touchdown from him to beat Virginia, 32-25.  Not the type of performance you want if the Playoffs are their goal. ---  The most disappointing team this season is thankfully not Oregon, but rather their marquee non-conference matchup from last year, Michigan State, who's lost six in a row after starting the season 2-0.  What in the world happened to the Spartans? --- Clearly, no one is benefiting from Northwestern's strange season more than unbeaten Western Michigan.  The Broncos aren't going to play in the Playoffs even if they are unbeaten but they can still make a New Year's Six Bowl.  Fortunately, that task just got easier after Boise State got upset by Wyoming, a 30-28 win by the Cowboys, who won it with a safety in the last minute.  Of course, Western Michigan needs to remain unbeaten and make it in the Top 15 for consideration.  Right now, they're ranked 20th.  I love a good underdog story. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Clemson</li>
<li>Washington</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Louisville</li>
<li>Wisconsin (+1)</li>
<li>Texas A&M (+2)</li>
<li>Nebraska (-2)</li>
<li>Florida (NR)</li>
</ol>
