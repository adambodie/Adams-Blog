alt: White Privilege II - by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis
intro: "Yesterday, the hip-hop game was jolted by the new song from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, 'White Privilege II,' a vicious track almost nine minutes long that discusses racism in the hip-hop world, in general, the Black Lives Matter movement, and how 'White America' is at an advantage as opposed to minorities. Though this is not the first time Macklemore has discussed racism in his music; the original White Privilege was a song he released back in 2005, now that Macklemore is famous worldwide, the platform is expanded exponentially with his fame, social media and a generation of racism sensitivity. Therefore, more people have a say than they did in 2005, when Macklemore was just a starving underground rapper from Seattle that until his unprecedented rise to fame, represented a city whose only taste of mainstream success was Sir Mix-a-Lot and his butt loving song Baby Got Back. While Macklemore will never understand what it's like to actually be a black person (something he is completely aware with), this track is important nonetheless as we will never get past racism without talking about it."

<p>Much of the initial attention is on the song's second verse, where he raps 'You've exploited and stolen the music, the moment / The magic, the passion, the fashion, you toy with / The culture was never yours to make better / You're Miley, you're Elvis, you're Iggy Azalea / Fake and so plastic, you've heisted the magic / You've taken the drums and the accent you rapped in / You're branded 'hip-hop', it's so fascist and backwards / That Grandmaster Flash'd go slap it, you bastard.'  Not surprisingly, in a battle loving hip-hop culture, it's Macklemore calling out musicians who have appropriated black culture in their music to advance their careers, calling them out for biting the culture but not having a clue about the African-American community itself.  Though Elvis is long deceased and Miley Cyrus doesn't have much of an opinion, it was Iggy Azalea who took offense, completely missing the point of the song, instead focusing solely on herself.  Not surprising for an Australian white female pop-rapper who believes she can have street-cred acting black and be a pop rapper at the same time, which most people know can't be done.    Of course, there's more to this song than one rapper getting her feelings hurt, in a world where black people fear for their lives and feel discriminated against, this is the big picture.  The main point here is that some white artists act black to make themselves look cool but without the actual struggle the black community faces, it comes off as not authentic by any means.</p>

<p>Earlier in the song, Macklemore raps 'Am I in the outside looking in, or am I in the inside looking out? / Is it my place to give my two cents / Or should I stand on the side and shut my mouth for justice? No peace / Okay, I'm saying that they're chanting out, 'Black lives matter', but I don't say it back / Is it okay for me to say? I don't know, so I watch and stand / In front of a line of police that look the same as me.'  Suggesting that it's awkward for a white person to support movements like Black Lives Matter due to having the same skin color as the police.  Even though Macklemore understands to the extent that he can that he agrees with the black communities concerns, he fears that someone like him will get backlash as he's not a minority in the sense, and therefore, doesn't understand what they're going through.  It's a bridge that has been divided for ages, where people like Spokane NAACP president Rachel Dolezal can claim to be an African-American, but as a Caucasian, she took things too far by pretending to be black, yet claiming discrimination from a historically African-American university for being white.  It's that type of thinking of believing you can have it both ways when you can't that Macklemore alludes to here, as he can appreciate Blacks Lives Matter but can't step into their shoes as a white person.</p>

<p>Later in the second verse, comes these bars 'You speak about equality, but do you really mean it? / Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient? / Want people to like you, want to be accepted / That's probably why you are out here protesting.'  To me, it's saying that you can act offended when someone is hurt or attacked for their skin, religion, sexuality, etc., but you're only aware of it because you heard about it somewhere.  Most of the time, people like this act like something needs to be done, yet don't understand anything about the people themselves.  For example, you can decry racist attacks against the black community, yet until you've actually spent time with the black community, you really have no perspective on what they're actually fighting for, how they feel about society, etc.  It's akin to fighting with them, but from afar.  Again, this segregation of sorts makes things worse.  While it's true that minorities like to stick together, it also is not going to accomplish much in healing racial divides.  And for those in the majority, it diminishes your fight to protect minorities when you have no strong understanding of what you're fighting for, instead fighting for a cause simply to be fighting for a cause.</p>

<p>The third verse focuses on Macklemore's own career and how some people may like him solely for being white.  With lines such as 'Even an old mom like me likes it cause it's positive / You're the only hip-hop that I let my kids listen to / Cause you get it, all that negative stuff isn't cool / Yeah, like all the guns and the drugs /The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs,' Macklemore suggests that being white makes him perceived as positive, while black rappers are all stereotyped as gangsters and thugs.  Even though there are many black rappers who aren't gangsters and thugs, such as Common, Talib Kweli and Lupe Fiasco, to name a few, they don't get the same 'respect' as Macklemore receives for their lyrics, nor do they enjoy the same commercial success Macklemore has achieved.</p>

<p>One line that really struck me was on the following verse, where Macklemore writes 'It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist / Than we actually are with racism.' I find that line to be particularly powerful as many people don't even think about racism or its effects on society until they say something perceived as racist and are called racist.  It's only then that the person even thinks about racism.  Many times, I've heard people say stupid things that people interpret as racist, and the first thing these people say is 'I'm not racist.'  It's another part of being unwilling to deal with racism and its repercussions until someone accuses you of being racist because you said something that stereotypes minorities, black or not.</p>

<p>Another line that perfectly sums up Macklemore's views on white privilege is from these bars 'But the one thing the American dream fails to mention / Is I was many steps ahead to begin with / My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image / America feels safe with my music in their systems / And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it / And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain.' It's this type of understanding that led Macklemore to text Kendrick Lamar after winning the Grammy for Rap Album of the Year in 2014, telling Kendrick Lamar he deserved to win the award.  Macklemore felt that being white led to the voters to favor him over the black artists he was faced against.  With the recent controversy over the lack of diversity with the Oscar's, with the majority of its voters old and white, voting for actors, actresses, etc. voting for white people, it's easy to see why Macklemore released this song now (of course, it should be noted the track will appear on their upcoming album 'This Unruly Mess I've Made' to be released next month).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking line is featured at the end of his last verse, where he repeats: 'We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by / We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives?'. It basically sums up the whole song, as people tend to 'appreciate the black culture' but don't take the time to appreciate black people themselves, as if we are taking all the 'cool parts' while tossing aside the 'bad parts' of the black people (i.e. the pain and suffering).  It's definitely something that needs to be addressed, not only in the hip-hop world, but society in general.  The majority of hip-hop fans are white, yet they have not suffered the same emotions that black people have in their lives.  They have no idea what it truly is like to be black, they just think it's cool to talk slang, dance and dress all 'fresh.'  At what point do the fans truly understand what's going on?</p>

<p>So how does all of this equate to white privilege?  Musically, with the majority of fans white, whether it's hip/hop, rock n roll, pop are whatever, it comes down to fans relating more to white musicians than black musicians.  When it comes to black musicians, they are too often stereotyped as being gangsters, when they may not be.  For white musicians, they are perceived different, as if they are less threatening, even though they may be just as bad.  For these fans, they like 'black music' because it seems cool, but yet they will never live their lives, never have the same perspective, and most likely never suffer the same pain.  Macklemore has enjoyed acclaim for his work, but chances are, a black artist would get less attention releasing songs like those Macklemore has released.</p>

<p>What needs to happen to get past this?  For starters, we need to confront the issues head-on.  As Macklemore alludes to in the song, remaining silent does not accomplish anything, it's basically implying that you're okay with the status quo.  We need to come together, not fight from afar to make ourselves look better.  Most important thing is that we need to understand our own shortcomings.  Too many times, those in the majority don't understand what it really is like to be a minority, to wonder if you're being targeted for being a minority.  It's also difficult for the majority to understand why minorities think that they're being targeted.  Some of it is environmental, some of it is sociological, some of it is pure genetics.  Unless you can walk in their shoes, which you can't really do, the white majority will never understand the pain and suffering the minorities suffer, nor will they realize how much easier it is to be in the majority.  Studies have suggested in the past that people have racist tendencies, whether intentional or subconscious racism, it's up for us to decide whether to ignore it or do something about it.</p>
