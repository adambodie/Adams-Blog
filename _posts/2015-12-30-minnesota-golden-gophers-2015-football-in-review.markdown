intro: "The 2015 season for the Minnesota Golden Gophers didn't quite meet the expectations that many fans might have had after a well-played 2014 season, but yet despite the bumps in the road, Minnesota is showing signs of life as a competitive football team.  Whether 2016 will be any better remains to be seen, but at the moment, Minnesota did vanquish at least one demon."

<p>The season began with a hard fought loss to highly talented and then highly ranked TCU.  A team with an explosive offense was held to just 23 points by Minnesota's defense, and playing at home, Minnesota definitely took advantage of the crowd to the best of their abilities.  But alas, the more talented team won.  Despite this, Minnesota's hopes still remained.  The rest of the non-conference games, against Colorado State, Kent State and Ohio were all much closer than they should have been, mainly because Minnesota's offense struggled to get going, but yet they won their games, even completing a late fourth-quarter comeback against Colorado State, which ended up in overtime and a win.</p>

<p>The conference schedule to say the least was quite brutal.  Of their seven losses on the year, six of them were to ranked teams, the aforementioned TCU, Northwestern, Michigan, Ohio State, Iowa and Wisconsin.  They notable faced Michigan, Ohio State and Iowa three weeks in a row.  Though Minnesota wasn't beaten particularly badly in any of those games, they still could not pull the signature win they needed.  The biggest heartbreaker came against Michigan.</p>

<p>The same week Michigan came to town, coach Jerry Kill was forced to retire due to his seizure problems returning.  Not an easy choice for a coach who practically bleed footballs, but Kill's health is more important, as part of the intensity that got him to where he was was contributing to his seizures.  It was a sad day for the Golden Gophers when he left, but yet to me, Jerry Kill has perhaps started a foundation that I hope stays with the Golden Gophers for many years to come.  Then came the Michigan game, which Minnesota outplayed Michigan virtually the entire game, but with 19 seconds down by three, Minnesota appeared to have caught the winning touchdown, but replays showed him inches short.  Perhaps due to being shocked and frazzled, Minnesota let the clock run down far too much and eventually tried to sneak in the winning touchdown, as opposed to tying it with a field goal.  Sadly, quarterback Mitch Leidner was stuffed by the defense.</p>

<p>The Gophers were competitive, but ultimately, the Golden Gophers finished the regular season 5-7.  But despite the losing record, in these days, where we have way too many bowl games, there weren't enough winning teams to place in all 40 bowl games, as with only 77 teams .500 or above, 3 teams with losing records had to be invited to play.  For once, academics paid off, as Minnesota had one of the highest Academic Progress Rates amongst the 5-7 teams.  Thanks to this criteria, Minnesota joined Nebraska and San Jose State in the bowl games.  Thus, Minnesota was off to the Quick Lane Bowl to play Central Michigan.  With Minnesota making no apologies for being there, not wanting to finish 5-8 and the extra motivation of a seven game bowl losing streak (who could forget the 31 point lead they blew in 2006 in the Insight Bowl to Texas Tech), Minnesota ended its season with a high note, beating Central Michigan 21-14 to win the Quick Lane Bowl.</p

><p>Looking back, the season was a minor disappointment, but with an incredibly tough schedule (with teams like Michigan and Iowa, whom the Gophers had beaten last season, were far better teams this year), and losing key offensive players David Cobb and Maxx Williams last season definitely hurt the Gophers.  Maxx Williams is hard to replace, a freakishly talented tight end, and while Minnesota have some young talented running backs with Shannon Brooks and Rodney Smith, neither one could replace the talent of Cobb.  On the plus side, Mitch Leidner, though he started off really slow, he found his rhythm later in the season, showed his heart and helped the Gophers win their bowl game.  Their defense played well, but had their weaknesses as well which need to be fixed.  And as for the coaching staff, Tracy Claeys, Jerry Kill's trusty defensive coordinator, was promoted to head coach a couple of weeks after Kill stepped down.  The Gophers have a bright future ahead, a stable coaching staff and a fanbase that's starting to show up and appreciate the team.  Let's hope 2016 is a step in the right direction.</p>
