intro: "It's survival week in Week 11 for the Oregon Ducks, who played against Stanford to have one last shot at turning around their season and making a bowl game, which seemed like a forgone conclusion at the beginning of the season.  For Minnesota, it's the start of Minnesota's true challenges to determine their worth in the Big Ten West, heading to Nebraska to see if they still have an outside shot of winning the West.  How well would this turn out for each team?  How would the playoff chase take shape, in what turned out to be a crazy Playoff Saturday."

		<h4>Pharaoh Brown: The Definition of Tough</h4>
</div>

    <p>Oregon faced Stanford, who's had a bit of a down season compared to years past, but finds themselves healthy at the right time as Christian McCaffrey, battling some injuries, looked ready to avenge Stanford's only Pac-12 loss last year against Oregon.  And with Oregon's defense being so terrible and their offensive line banged up and full of freshmen, Stanford easily won 52-27.  It was their last home game for the season, as their last two games will be at the road against Utah and Oregon State, with no bowl game for Oregon.  One nice thing to see was TE Pharaoh Brown in his last game at Autzen Stadium being honored on Senior Day before the game.  Pharaoh Brown has come a long way from his gruesome leg injury two seasons ago at Utah.  It's a miracle that not only has he recovered from nearly having his leg amputated, but has contributed to about the same level of play that he had before the injury.  Next week, Pharaoh Brown and the Ducks head back to Utah for the first time, which will surely be an emotional game for Brown.  The good news for the Ducks: Basketball season begins with the Ducks highest preseason ranking ever at #5.</p>
    <p>The Gophers faced their toughest opponent of the season so far in a rare Big Ten evening matchup against Nebraska.  The Cornhuskers, who have lost their last two games after an unbeaten start (albeit against Ohio State and Wisconsin), still have a shot at the Big Ten West title.  Minnesota was obviously the underdogs, in a tough environment, and for the most part, they hung tough, but like the Penn State game, Minnesota could not produce in the second half, after having a 17-10 halftime lead.  In the end, Nebraska won 24-17, as Tommy Armstrong led the way for the Cornhuskers, accounting for most of their offense.  A typical performance for Mitch Leidner, who showed his typical good moments and bad moments, an interception on the last drive sealed the win for Nebraska.  The Gophers have some talent, but lack the umph to get them to the next step.  </p>
    <p>After Texas A&M took a bow, Washington entered in the top four where it originally belonged.  But they blew an opportunity to stay there (or go higher), getting stunned by the Cheaters.  It isn't that shocking considering how easy Washington's schedule has been up to this point, but still stunning nonetheless.  Even more shocking and less expected was Clemson, who lost to Pittsburgh at home, with Pitt winning it with a field goal at the end of the game.  Clemson won a bunch of close games, but their luck ran out tonight.  And to top it off, Michigan also lost, with Iowa stunning them with a field goal in a 14-13 upset.  With the way the season's going, Michigan, Washington and Clemson are still alive in the playoff hunt, but one thing is clear; Alabama is clearly the best team in the country and the odds-on favorite to repeat as National Champions; the only major unbeaten team left of the bunch (Western Michigan is unbeaten as well but not a major contender).  Of course, their Iron Bowl rival Auburn lost to Georgia, eliminating them from the chase. That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Ohio State, Louisville, Wisconsin and Oklahoma.  The final three teams have been added to the list but the former six are the best shots at this point.</p>

		<h4>It's Karma Chameleon Time for Kansas WR LaQuvionte Gonzalez</h4>
</div>    
    <p>In what might be the funniest trick play I've ever seen, Kansas WR LaQuvionte Gonzalez laid down in the endzone on a kickoff return in an attempt to camouflage in the blue field, only to get up and catch a backwards lateral from kick returner Steven Sims Jr. for a 29 yard gain. --- Division III powerhouse Mount Union saw their 112 game regular season winning streak end today against John Carroll, losing 31-28.  The streak, which began in 2005, stands as one of two regular season losses for Mount Union, as they had previously gone 222-1 since 1994, the last season they didn't win their conference championship.  Very impressive, no matter the level of competition. --- Sad story out of Florida International, as their starting TE Jonnu Smith suffered multiple burns on his body, allegedly from his girlfriend pouring water on him in a fight.  I really hate stories like this, I hope he has a speedy recovery and can play again.  His career at FIU is over, but he's listed as a potential NFL prospect.  --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State (+3)</li>
<li>Michigan (-1)</li>
<li>Louisville (+2)</li>
<li>Clemson (-2)</li>
<li>Wisconsin (+1)</li>
<li>Washington (-3)</li>
<li>Oklahoma (+2)</li>
<li>Penn State</li>
<li>Oklahoma State (NR)</li>
</ol>
