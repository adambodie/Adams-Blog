intro: "Four years ago, I set out to write an article on Innocent Online Stalking.  The results of the article were quite fascinating.  I met a young woman named Jennifer Bodie and asked her about her online stalking.  She described in length how it affected her and why she did it.  I decided to do a follow up to check in with Jenn and see if she's still doing it."

<p>Amazingly, Jenn is still stalking people innocently online, still through Facebook.  Jenn friends her own childhood friends on Facebook, not to be real friends with them, but to snoop on their pages and see what they're up to.  Sometimes, Jenn friends, unfriends and friends them again, just because she's bored of not knowing what these people are up to.</p>
<p>Are you a part of Jenn's past?  Chances are, Jenn has looked you up on Facebook, gone through your friends, and mocked you for who you are.  High school peoples Jenn didn't like, you're not safe from Innocent Online Stalkers like Jenn.  Former co-workers that Jenn didn't like working with?  Don't try to hide, and if you do, watch out.  Jenn's coming for you.</p>
<p>When we talked to Jenn in 2011, we talked about her online stalking of a certain Alabama chick who wanted to start a Horse Molestation Club.  We asked Jenn if she still stalks her.  The answer is no, as Jenn has bigger fish to prey, she told us.  She even got the idiot ex to 'Like' a sarcastic post complimenting him and friending her on LinkedIn, apparently oblivious to the fact that Jenn can't stand the fool.</p>
<p>But now Jenn has taken Innocent Online Stalking to a whole new level.  Her latest target, David Brian Michael, a former friend of a relative wanted out of Washington County for check fraud, identity theft and forgery.  In addition to checking his Facebook every day hoping he'll slip up and reveal his location, Jenn is stalking his family members and friends, hoping someone will say something stupid, from Oregon to Louisiana.  No one's safe from Jenn the Innocent Online Stalker.  According to Jenn, it's important to bring this clown to justice.  So remember, if you've seen or heard from David Brian Michael, call the police and send him to prison.  You can make a difference.</p>
