alt: How is this even possible? Aaron Gordon does the unthinkable
intro: "All Star Saturday Night has always been my favorite part of the All-Star Weekend. The All Star Game itself is fine and all, but it's too much of an exhibition game with no defense. Friday night, with the Rising Stars game, is much of the same. But Saturday Night, with the Three Point Contest and the Slam Dunk Contest, are for the fans."

	<h4>How is this even possible? Aaron Gordon does the unthinkable</h4>
</div>

<p>As a kid, I loved watching the Slam Dunk contest.  Crazy ass dunks that defy gravity and logic always made me smile.  I was too young to watch the classic Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins battles, but I've seen plenty of highlights of their battles.  To me, Vince Carter's dunks in the 2000 contest were the best ever.  It was a contest to remember, everyone who saw that contest knew it was his, even Vince Carter, who motioned to the camera that 'it was over.'  But that also brought a rapid decline afterwards, as the dunks got more repetitive, the players became less interesting, the format got worse and the players kept missing their dunks, sucking all the life force out of their attempts.  Not to mention the lame props, the mascots, Dwight Howard's Superman costume, Blake Griffin dunking over a Kia Optima, etc.</p>

<p>But last year gave me a reason to believe, and his name was Zach LaVine.  A rookie for the Minnesota Timberwolves, the dunks he made were not only mind-blowing, but he made them look so effortlessly that it was hard to believe they were difficult at all, but they were.  He didn't need props, he just dunked.  He won that contest easily, and of course, he took the opportunity to defend his title.  Most people, myself included, felt the contest was his to lose.  The other three players didn't seem worthy, Andre Drummond, Will Barton and Aaron Gordon, all first timers.  After the contest was over tonight, it's clear the Slam Dunk Contest has finally awoken.  Back with a vengeance, and again, the best of Saturday Night.</p>

<p>Andre Drummond and Will Barton didn't do much.  Drummond, the All-Star center, was at a disadvantage as a big man.  They don't usually win it, and Drummond was inconsistent.  His second dunk saw Steve Nash trying to kick the ball to him.  Amar'e Stoudemire did this years ago with Nash, but Stoudemire's was better, and Nash's poor soccer skills reminded me of why his stint with the Lakers was quite terrible.  Will Barton had a nice first dunk, but missed his second.  His best performance was his Thriller dance, sad to say.</p>

<p>Aaron Gordon, on the other hand, had some nice dunks in the first round.  The first one was not good, but his second one, jumping over the Orlando Magic mascot Stuff the Magic Dragon, had some difficulty to it, making it more impressive.  One thing about the Slam Dunk contest is that some dunks look better in slo-mo than in real life.  This dunk was no exception as Gordon jumped over Stuff and brought it back up for the slam, with a score of 49.  Zach LaVine was equally as impressive as the first time, jumping from about the free throw line for an alley-oop.  Why Shaq gave both Gordon's and LaVine's second dunks a 9 is perhaps the biggest mystery.  But it set up for the best final round of all time.</p><p>Both Gordon and LaVine kept making damn near impossible dunks, they each got perfect 50's in the final round.  But some 50's seemed to be better than other 50's.  Gordon and LaVine's first dunk seemed almost identical, except Gordon got the ball from Stuff, who was riding a hoverboard twirling 360 degrees, as Gordon grabbed it perfectly, and as an added bonus, posed midair with his other hand on his head.  LaVine did almost the same thing without the mascot and pose.  Both got a 50.  But Gordon's seemed like it would be a 55 if that was even possible.  I might've understood both 50's if LaVine had gone first, but he went last.  Either way, both very impressive, plus it led to the greatest duel since MJ-Nique in 1988.</p>

<p>Gordon's second dunk of the final round was the best dunk of the night.  Another spot-on performance for Stuff, except this time Gordon got the ball under both his legs and up for the dunk.  In slo-mo, it looked like he was sitting for a second.  It was enough to get everyone out of their chairs.  Of course he got a 50, yet could have gotten a 60 if that was possible.  Not to be outdone, LaVine did a windmill dunk from the free-throw line.  An impressive dunk, another perfect 50.  So with each getting two perfect 50s in the final round, it was time for a dunk-off.</p>

<p>The night was only beginning, as Gordon got a pass from teammate Elfrid Payton off the side of the backboard with a reverse windmill jam.  Another effortless 50 for Gordon, and LaVine responded with another 50 dunk.  Tied again, another dunk-off was needed and again, two perfect 50's, with more impressive dunks.  By the third dunk-off, Gordon appeared to be out of ideas.  Was this the end for Aaron Gordon?  His dunk, putting the ball over his head, back down to his knees and up for the dunk was impressive, but he only got a 47 since it seemed rather pedestrian to his other mind-boggling slams.  Now LaVine had an opening, and he too didn't know what to do.  How did he respond to the opening?  A between the legs dunk from just under the free-throw line.  A dunk he admitted he never tried before.  Perfect 50, game over, advantage: Zach LaVine, who only got docked one point by Shaq the entire night.</p>

<p>But let's be honest, Aaron Gordon was the best dunker of the night.  In virtually every other year before last year, he would have easily won it with the dunks he made; they were out of this world.  Only Zach LaVine could match him.  And trust me, LaVine was impressive.  Dunking from the free-throw line (essentially the free-throw line, but still, Dr. J wasn't perfect either when he did it in 1976) is impressive enough, but an alley-oop, windmill and between the legs from the free-throw line, all in the same night, sick!  All the dunks Zach LaVine got a 50 on, he deserved a 50. But Gordon's dunks over Stuff were downright insane, especially the one under his legs.  How is that even possible?  He managed to break my 'no-prop' rule with that dunk alone.  By the night's end, I was standing waiting to see if an ending would occur.  They could've gone at it all night long if they wanted.  Zach LaVine put it best after the contest was over, they both deserved the title.  And it was truly the sickest, craziest and best Slam Dunk Contest ever.  Only Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins battling for the title in 1988 was as competitive as this one.  But Aaron Gordon's perfect 50 dunks seemed more impressive than LaVine's perfect 50 dunks.  How can perfect be considered perfect when one perfect score is better than another perfect score?  The real winners of the night were of course, the fans, and maybe Stuff the Magic Dragon, who probably had the most fun getting dunked on and twirling on a hoverboard.</p>
