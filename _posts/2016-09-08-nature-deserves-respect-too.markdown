intro: "On August 29th, a group of idiots, believing they can do whatever they want without any repercussions, destroyed a famous rock at Cape Kiwanda known as Duckbill.  Fortunately, someone recorded them committing the act and confronted them over it.  But the damage was done, all because some idiots couldn’t read a sign and blamed everyone but themselves for something that was obviously avoidable.  Too many people take nature for granted, and it deserves every bit of respect it gets."

<p>I have been to Cape Kiwanda a few times and it is to me, one of the most beautiful areas along the Oregon Coast.  But I also know the risks of being close to the edge and I will respect signs that say 'Do Not Enter.'  For this reason, I never saw or heard of the Duckbill before it was destroyed, but it looked pretty, just like the whole area.  I admit, I have crossed signs I was told not to, but I always take the highest precautions and never stray too far from the trail, usually not more than a few steps beyond the path.  Safety is important.  Unfortunately, these Idiots crossed the Do Not Enter sign, and even worse, took it upon themselves to destroy a popular spot, for incredibly stupid reasons.  These idiots excuse?  They were doing the world a favor by preventing anyone else from getting hurt because one of these idiots broke his leg standing on top the Duckbill.  It was not for them to take matters for themselves, especially when they shouldn’t have been there in the first place.  That is a complete disregard for nature and selfishness on their behalf.</p>
<p>Living in Oregon, it’s not surprising that people like me love nature and cherish it for its beauty and mystique.  And not surprisingly, I have seen many stories of idiots not giving a damn about nature.  Last year, some dweebs etched their names in a railing at Tumalo Falls, and felt entitled to do so after being confronted by someone who took a picture of them showcasing their 'art.'  It’s reasons like this that make me disgusted with entitled pricks, and more reasons to appreciate nature for what it is.  Nature is alive and energetic, just like humans, animals and plants.</p>

<p>There are plenty of things to love about nature, yet others would love to destroy it for profit.  Just like the pathetic Bundy clan and their anti-government militiamen.  If it were up to them, they would completely destroy nature just so they could make money.  That’s what their stupid mantra is all about.  They can claim the government has no right to land ownership, but some land is worth cherishing for its beauty.  Can you imagine if the Grand Canyon was owned by corporations and built all the properties they could?  That would completely devalue the natural beauty the Grand Canyon has to offer.  It's the same with those who pollute the Earth and all the land they are near in the name of profit.  I’ve never been to Glacier National Park, but reading its history and seeing the pictures, one can clearly see how global warming has damaged the very fabric the park has to offer, its Glaciers.  I would love to go there before they’re completely melted away by outside interests.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you don't truly appreciate something until it's gone.  This is no exception with nature.  Humans aren't necessarily the root of all the destroying of nature, some of it is natural.  The famous Old Man of the Mountain, which was arguably one of New Hampshire's most famous attractions, collapsed in 2003 to much disappointment, but it 'died' of natural causes.  With events like this, you never really know how long nature will last.  It certainly doesn't help when humans take it for granted and outright trash and destroy parts of it.  Earlier this year, a group of frat boy punks had too much fun on Lake Shasta and when they were done, completely disregarded it, leaving all their trash there, acting as if nature is nothing more than a toilet.  But it's not, because believe it or not, some people actually value nature.</p>

<p>I will be the first person to admit I haven't been completely perfect with nature.  As a young'un, I thought it would be cool to take a piece of lava from Lava Butte, and when I was older, a little piece of the Painted Hills, but in retrospect, was it really worth it?  Not really.  It seemed like good sentimental value, but it doesn't beat the memories itself, the pictures I've taken and seen, nor the experience itself.  Some dweebs take things for granted, do stupid things and feel as if it's not worth protecting, that somehow, it's an inconvenience when you get hurt from the more perilous parts of nature.  In the end, when humans do stupid things, they'll blame everyone but themselves.</p>
