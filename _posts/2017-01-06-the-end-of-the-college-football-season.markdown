intro: "It's been one hell of a ride this season, but on Monday, the National Championship will be played, a rematch of last season's National Championship between Alabama and Clemson.  The semi-finals were both duds competitive wise as Alabama and Clemson were clearly better than Washington and Ohio State, but if last year's game is any indication, this should be a great follow-up."

<p>As I suspected would happen, Minnesota swung for the fences, or should I say, rowed the boat to Kalamazoo to hire P.J. Fleck as their coach.  Clearly he was their first choice and with the success he had turning Western Michigan from a nobody to a Cotton Bowl appearance in four years is impressive no matter what conference he played in, it's easy to see why it happened.  With that said, Minnesota has handled this whole situation very poorly.  There's a lot of uncertainty with the Gophers, starting with the Quarterback position.  Only time will tell whether Fleck becomes the next Urban Meyer or the next Darrell Hazell, but Fleck is a good hire to fix the teams offensive issues.  I personally felt Claeys didn't deserve to be treated the way he did, and although he wasn't given the time to prove whether he could actually coach or not, it's defendable to say that the Gophers should have rowed the boat to Fleck.  But the situation was handled poorly and it would have been better for AD Mark Coyle simply to admit that he didn't want Claeys in the first place for directional reasons rather than bring the sexual assault related issues into it.</p>
<p>The Bowl season has seen some exciting games and some disappointing stinkers.  Both semi-final games were lopsided, and Ohio State couldn't muster up one point against Clemson.  Clearly, the best game played so far was the Rose Bowl, which saw USC jump out to a big lead only for Penn State to roar back in the third quarter for a big lead of their own.  But The Nittany Lions came up short against the Cheaters, who won 52-49, the highest scoring Rose Bowl game ever, surpassing the Oregon Ducks 45-38 win in 2012 against Wisconsin.  But USC couldn't break Oregon's record for most points in a Rose Bowl game, when the Ducks won the first playoff game ever with a 59-10 romp of Florida State.  Another great game was the Orange Bowl which saw Florida State battle with Michigan, surviving a Wolverine comeback to win 33-32.  And Virginia Tech, down 24-0 at halftime, came back to beat the squealers of Arkansas 35-24.  This of course is the competition for best game in the Bowl Season that Alabama and Clemson have to face, though any close game will be the best since this is the national championship.  One thing is for sure, I currently sit with a 22-19 bowl game record, which I won't complain about.</p>
<p>Not much has changed for Clemson as they are still led by the great QB DeShaun Watson, who has continued to play to the high level he's accustomed to.  Alabama still has the elite defense they're known for, but their offense is different from last years offense, with freshman Quarterback Jalen Hurts leading the way.  Also to note is that Lane Kiffin, who apparently thought it would be easier to handle two jobs with his new head coaching position than focus on one, was given the boot for being late to multiple practices.  Why did Florida Atlantic hire this moron?  We'll see what effect, if any, that has on the Alabama offense.  But despite all of this, Alabama has been ranked number one all season and I still don't see any reason to believe they'll lose it now.  But there's no way I'll root for the Crimson Tide.  Go Tigers!</p>
