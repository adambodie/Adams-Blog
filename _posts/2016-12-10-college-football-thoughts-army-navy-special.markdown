intro: "The last official regular season game is always between Army and Navy, as Army entered the game with a 14 game losing streak against Navy dating back to 2001.  This year, Army has looked better than they have, entering the game above .500, which has happened only once in the past 20 years.  Navy entered the game limping at 9-3, with some key injuries and losing the Temple in the AAC championship game.  Would this be the year Army finally beats Navy?"

		<h4>Army finally beat Navy</h4>
</div>
<p>Fortunately for Army, the answer is yes, as Army won a hard fought game, beating Navy 21-17.  You always have to appreciate those who fight for us, not only Army and Navy, but also Air Force, which also went 9-3 and won the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy by beating both Army and Navy.  --- Tonight is the Heisman Trophy presentation, with five finalists: Lamar Jackson (QB Louisville), DeShaun Watson (QB Clemson), Baker Mayfield (QB Oklahoma), Dede Westbrook (WR Oklahoma), and Jabril Peppers (LB Michigan).  Lamar Jackson was absolutely dynamite early in the season and quickly jumped out as a front-runner by a wide margin.  But his last two games, losses to Houston and Kentucky, exposed him and left a opening for one of the other candidates to win.  So was that enough for Lamar Jackson to win the Heisman?  It was.  Congratulations to Lamar Jackson for winning the Heisman Trophy this year.  Despite the late season struggles, no one even came close to the production Lamar Jackson brought to the field.  So with all that said, now I'm going to predict every bowl game, from the worst to the best, to my Gophers to the most irrelevant of teams (I'll pick North Texas).  Here we go.</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Air Force Reserve Celebration Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>North Carolina Central vs. Grambling</p>
        <p>December 17th</p>
        <p>Two HBCU's (historically black colleges & universities) from the FCS play in the Air Force Reserve Celebration Bowl.  My pick is <strong>Grambling</strong> because their only loss was to Arizona by 10.</p>
    </li>

    		<h4>Any team with the nickname Roadrunners is cool with me</h4>
    </div>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Gildan New Mexico Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>New Mexico vs. UTSA</p>
        <p>December 17th</p>
        <p>As much as I'd love to see the Texas San Antonio Roadrunners win this game, due to their nickname, I'm picking <strong>New Mexico</strong> to win the New Mexico Bowl.  It only makes sense.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Las Vegas Bowl presented by Geico</strong></p>
        <p>Houston vs. San Diego State</p>
        <p>December 17th</p>
        <p>Houston may have beaten Oklahoma and Louisville, but had a disappointing season losing to Navy, Memphis and SMU, while losing coach Tom Herman to Texas.  They made a great hire to promote offensive coordinator Major Applewhite to the job.  They'll have their hands full against Donnel Pumphrey, who along with Texas RB D'Onta Foreman, rushed for 2000 plus yards in the regular season, currently ranked second on the all-time NCAA list and needs 108 yards to break Ron Dayne's all time record. The most fascinating of the bowl games of the day, but I'm picking <strong>Houston</strong> to win it with their defense, holding Pumphrey short of the record.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Raycom Media Camellia Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Appalachian State vs. Toledo</p>
        <p>December 17th</p>
        <p>Appalachian State, which won this bowl game last year, will always hold a special place in my heart for their historic upset against Michigan in 2007.  With that said, Toledo will be plenty to handle with their high flying offense.  This game can go either way, but I'll pick <strong>Toledo</strong> in a close high scoring game.</p>
    </li>

    </div>
    <li>
        <p><strong>AutoNation Cure Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>UCF vs. Arkansas State</p>
        <p>December 17th</p>
        <p>Former Oregon Offensive Coordinator Scott Frost led UCF to a 6-6 record after the Knights finished winless the year before.  Arkansas State is 7-5 whose best win came against Troy.  I'm picking <strong>UCF</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Southern Mississippi vs. Louisiana-Lafayette</p>
        <p>December 17th</p>
        <p>With all due respect, they should just cancel this game.  Both teams went 6-6, a rather hum-drum matchup between two schools that are only playing in a bowl game because of the plethora of games.  But I'll pick the <strong>Ragin' Cajuns of Louisiana-Lafayette</strong> for having one of the best nicknames in college football.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Miami Beach Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Central Michigan vs. Tulsa</p>
        <p>December 19th</p>
        <p>Karma is a B**ch, and it will catch up to the Chippewas of Central Michigan, whose controversial exciting upset of Oklahoma State should have never happened in the first place.  If not for that, the 6-6 Chippewas wouldn't even be here.  I'm picking <strong>Tulsa</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
    		<img src="/img/big-red.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Big Red" class="image block img-responsive">
    		<h4>I'm still not sure what Big Red is supposed to be</h4>
    </div>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Boca Raton Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Memphis vs. Western Kentucky</p>
        <p>December 20th</p>
        <p>Two under the radar teams face off in the Boca Raton Bowl as Memphis and Western Kentucky have quietly become good football teams, after years of being irrelevant losers.  I'm still not sure what Western Kentucky's mascot's big-red is all about, but I'm picking <strong>Western Kentucky</strong> to win a close game, despite their head coach Jeff Brohm recently taking the job at Purdue.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>BYU vs. Wyoming</p>
        <p>December 21st</p>
        <p>Wyoming has been a pleasant surprise, coach Craig Bohl has done a good job turning the program around after a successful job at North Dakota State.  With that said, BYU is more experienced, so while I'll root for the Cowboys, I'll pick <strong>BYU</strong> to win.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Famous Idaho Potato Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Idaho vs. Colorado State</p>
        <p>December 22nd</p>
        <p>The Vandals of Idaho have never been good historically, but enter the Potato Bowl with a home-field advantage.  But Colorado State has played a tougher schedule.  This one can go either way, but I'll pick <strong>Colorado State</strong> to win.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Popeyes Bahamas Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Eastern Michigan vs. Old Dominion</p>
        <p>December 23rd</p>
        <p>Eastern Michigan, never a good football team, are in their first bowl game since 1987.  On the other side is Old Dominion, playing in their first bowl game ever after joining the FBS in 2014 and restarting their football program in 2009.  And what a better place to play in a bowl than the Bahamas.  I'll pick <strong>Old Dominion</strong> to win because they've accomplished a lot in such little time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Louisiana Tech vs. Navy</p>
        <p>December 23rd</p>
        <p>Navy started off well, and were close to making a discussion for the Group of 5 winner based on their schedule, but losses to Temple in the AAC Championship game and rival Army for the first time since 2001 leave the Midshipmen wounded and sinking.  I'm picking <strong>Louisiana Tech</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Dollar General Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Ohio vs. Troy</p>
        <p>December 23rd</p>
        <p>It's the battle of short names as Ohio plays against Troy.  Ohio had a close loss to Western Michigan in the MAC Championship game and nearly beat Tennessee while Troy nearly beat mighty Clemson in a close 30-24 Clemson win.  I'll pick <strong>Ohio</strong> to win coming off a hard fought championship game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Hawai'i Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Hawai'i vs. Middle Tennessee</p>
        <p>December 24th</p>
        <p>The only team getting any joy from being in Hawai'i is Middle Tennessee, as 6-7 Hawai'i always gets to enjoy the fun of Hawai'i.  Though the Rainbow Warriors have the home-court advantage, they face a better offense as <strong>Middle Tennessee</strong> wins this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>St. Petersburg Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Miami (Ohio) vs. Mississippi State</p>
        <p>December 26th</p>
        <p>Another bowl game that shouldn't be played as Miami (Ohio), with a 6-6 record, faces Mississippi State, who enters the game with a losing 5-7 record, only qualifying with no winning teams available to select.  Last year, all three 5-7 teams won their bowl games, and Mississippi State, who pulled an upset against Texas A&M late in the season, faces a smaller-conference Miami (Ohio), who are on a six game winning streak after starting the season 0-6.  I'll pick <strong>Mississippi State</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Quick Lane Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Maryland vs. Boston College</p>
        <p>December 26th</p>
        <p>A battle between two former ACC Rivals who improved after bad seasons, neither Maryland nor Boston College are exciting to watch.  The Gophers won the Quick Lane Bowl last year, and I'll pick the Big Ten to continue to win a boring bowl game as <strong>Maryland</strong> gets the victory against Boston College.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Camping World Independence Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>NC State vs. Vanderbilt</p>
        <p>December 26th</p>
        <p>No 6-6 team had as big of an effect on the College Football Playoff hunt as NC State did, after missing a potential game-winning field goal against Clemson that would've completely altered the landscape of the season for not only the ACC but for the Playoff race in general.  Vandy played better to end the season, and has LB Zach Cunningham, who's one of the top defensive players in the country.  I'm picking <strong>Vanderbilt</strong> to win this matchup of 6-6 teams.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Zaxby's Heart of Dallas Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Army vs. North Texas</p>
        <p>December 27th</p>
        <p>Army, now having beaten Navy, enters the Heart of Dallas Bowl with a 7-5 record, holding their heads up high.  They face North Texas, who finished 5-7 and got in thanks to the plethora of bowl games and not enough positions to fill them with.  I'm picking <strong>Army</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Military Bowl Presented by Northrop Grumman</strong></p>
        <p>Temple vs. Wake Forest</p>
        <p>December 27th</p>
        <p>Temple enters the game as perhaps the hottest team outside the Power 5 conferences, winning the AAC and currently on a 7 game winning streak, impressive considering that they were once kicked out of the former Big East conference for being such a bad football team.  But their coach Matt Thule recently accepted the job at Baylor.  Wake Forest, 6-6, hasn't done anything particularly impressive.  So I'll give <strong>Temple</strong> the nod here.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>National Funding Holiday Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Minnesota vs. Washington State</p>
        <p>December 27th</p>
        <p>My Gophers finished the season 8-4, but yet they couldn't beat anyone better than them.  They won all the games they were supposed to, but couldn't quite pull up an upset, with their defense holding fort but their offense sputtering in the second half.  They face Washington State, whose Air Raid offense will keep the Gophers secondary on its toes all night.  A quasi-rematch of sorts from Minnesota's disastrous 31-point lead in the Insight Bowl against Mike Leach's Texas Tech that was blown to lose the game, this game will have the same setup as that game.  Minnesota's defense is up for the task against Washington State, who like Minnesota, struggled against the top teams in their conference, losing their last two games against Colorado and Washington.  But as typical of the Gophers season, in fact, the past few seasons, the game will be decided by QB Mitch Leidner.  Luke Falk has been consistent in his game as Wazzu's QB, but Mitch Leidner has struggled to find any consistency in his play, often using his feet to keep the Gophers in play.  Chances are, Leidner will never change, as <strong>Washington State</strong> will win.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Motel 6 Cactus Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Boise State vs. Baylor</p>
        <p>December 27th</p>
        <p>Baylor started the season under a lot of controversy over the Art Briles firing and the handling of Title IX issues, going 6-0.  Then QB Seth Russell got injured for the season and Baylor went from being a possible Playoff team to an average 6-6.  Boise State has had some good football teams in the past, and if not for stinging losses against Wyoming and Air Force, might've been playing in the Cotton Bowl.  I expect <strong>Boise State</strong> to win this game.</p>

    		<h4>One of the best stories this year, the comeback of James Conner</h4>
    </div>
    <li>
        <p><strong>New Era Pinstripe Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Pittsburgh vs. Northwestern</p>
        <p>December 28th</p>
        <p>Pittsburgh is one of the feel good teams in the country, led by running back James Conner, whose return to the game from battling Hodgkins Lymphoma last year has been one of the best stories in college football, plays against weird Northwestern in his final game, as Conner is heading to the NFL.  Pitt, having beaten both Penn State and Clemson, comes into the game playing their best football, while Northwestern has been difficult to figure out.  I'm sticking with consistency, as <strong>Pittsburgh</strong> wins this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Russell Athletic Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>West Virginia vs. Miami</p>
        <p>December 28th</p>
        <p>Former Big East rivals West Virginia and Miami play in the Russell Athletic Bowl, as West Virginia, having finished with a 10-2 record, were close to winning the Big XII title but didn't get the attention they deserved.  Miami also had the hype, but stumbled in Mark Richt's first season coaching the Hurricanes.  I'm picking <strong>West Virginia</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Foster Farms Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Indiana vs. Utah</p>
        <p>December 28th</p>
        <p>Utah entered the season as a possible Pac-12 championship contender, but faltered down the stretch, losing to Oregon.  Indiana finally learned to play defense under coach Kevin Wilson, but couldn't win the big game, as Kevin Wilson resigned after allegations of player misconduct surfaced.  Both teams enter this game wounded, but Utah still has the superior team.  With apologies to my cousin, I'm picking <strong>Utah</strong> to win easily.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>AdvoCare V100 Texas Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Texas A&M vs. Kansas State</p>
        <p>December 28th</p>
        <p>Another matchup of former conference foes, this one from the Big XII, as Texas A&M, who was ranked #4 in the first playoff rankings, stumbled after losing to Alabama, with their only wins during that stretch against non-conference foes New Mexico State and UTSA.  Kansas State had another solid season, with coach Bill Snyder proving how unflappable he is.  Though Texas A&M is the better team, I pick <strong>Kansas State</strong> in an upset, as they always play with their hearts.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Birmingham Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>South Florida vs. South Carolina</p>
        <p>December 29th</p>
        <p>South Florida enters the game with its best record since the program began in 1997, but Willie Taggart is now the coach for the Oregon Ducks.  They play South Carolina, who looked pretty average this year, finishing 6-6.  I'm picking <strong>South Florida</strong> to win.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Belk Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Arkansas vs. Virginia Tech</p>
        <p>December 29th</p>
        <p>Recently retired coach Frank Beamer was always a class act during his time at Virginia Tech.  Arkansas coach Bret Bielema is a meathead.  For that reason alone, I'm picking <strong>Virginia Tech</strong> to beat Arkansas.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Valero Alamo Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Oklahoma State vs. Colorado</p>
        <p>December 29th</p>
        <p>Perhaps the best Non-Playoff/New Year's Six bowl game is the always entertaining Alamo Bowl between another set of former Big XII rivals Oklahoma State and Colorado.  The Buffaloes have been the biggest surprise of the season, coming from the bottom of the Pac-12 barrel since their entrance in the conference to win the Pac-12 South.  Mike MacIntrye should be the coach of the year.  Oklahoma State, on the other hand, can play the disrespect card after that controversial loss to Central Michigan, as they were in the hunt for the Big XII title until the season finale against Oklahoma.  Colorado has perhaps the best secondary in the country, which could be enough to slow down Oklahoma State's offense.  <strong>Colorado</strong> wins to complete a successful turnaround they've long deserved.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>AutoZone Liberty Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Georgia vs. TCU</p>
        <p>December 30th</p>
        <p>The Liberty Bowl features two of the more disappointing teams in the country as neither Georgia nor TCU lived to their potential.  TCU has talented but inconsistent QB Kenny Hill, while Georgia was unable to take advantage of the talented RB Nick Chubb.  I'll pick <strong>TCU</strong> to win this game because Gary Patterson always finds a way to win (especially true last year at the Alamo Bowl).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Hyundai Sun Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Stanford vs. North Carolina</p>
        <p>December 30th</p>
        <p>This will be the end of the exciting career for all-world Running Back Christian McCaffrey, as he's off to the NFL after this game.  North Carolina, on the flipside, has QB Mitch Trubisky, who is rated as the top QB in next year's NFL Draft (I'm not sure why, I don't know enough about his game).  Either way, <strong>Stanford</strong> wins this game, giving McCaffrey a win to end his celebrated career.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Franklin American Mortgage Music City Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Nebraska vs. Tennessee</p>
        <p>December 30th</p>
        <p>A battle for two teams who had higher hopes in the season, Nebraska played well to begin the season, while going through the emotions of losing their punter Sam Foltz in a bus accident, but faltered down the stretch against the top Big Ten teams (Ohio State, Wisconsin).  Tennessee started the season ranked in the Top Ten and was seen as a lock to win the SEC East, but after multiple comeback wins, faltered down the stretch.  This game may come down to quarterback play, as Tommy Armstrong is battling a hamstring injury for the Cornhuskers and may not be able to play in this one.  Assuming he doesn't play, <strong>Tennessee</strong> will win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Nova Home Loans Arizona Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>South Alabama vs. Air Force</p>
        <p>December 30th</p>
        <p>South Alabama may be 6-6, and truth be told, they only won two conference games, but they did beat Mississippi State and San Diego State.  Air Force, on the other hand, finished 9-3 but finished 4th in the Mountain West West division.  Despite their name, Air Force almost exclusively runs the ball.  <strong>Air Force</strong> wins this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Capital One Orange Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Michigan vs. Florida State</p>
        <p>December 30th</p>
        <p>Two plays turned out to be the difference between Michigan winning the Big Ten and playing in the Playoffs, to winding up in the Orange Bowl and not even being selected for a New Year's Six game.  Florida State has played well late in the season, but was embarrassed by Louisville and lost to Clemson, knocking them out of the Playoff race.  Michigan has one of the best defenses in the country, which poses problems for FSU and their start running back Dalvin Cook.  Michigan is pissed for that reason, I'm picking <strong>Michigan</strong> to win this one.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>LSU vs. Louisville</p>
        <p>December 31st</p>
        <p>A classic battle between an offensive juggernaut and defensive stalwart takes place in the Citrus Bowl as Louisville, led by Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, faces off against the highly regarded defense of LSU.  Louisville played like a Playoff contender with their shakedown of Florida State, but stumbled late in the season with losses to Houston and Kentucky, making Lamar Jackson look average.  This should be one of the most entertaining bowl matchups, but defense wins champions, so I'm picking the rejuvenated <strong>LSU</strong> to win a close game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>TaxSlayer Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Georgia Tech vs. Kentucky</p>
        <p>December 31st</p>
        <p>Kentucky has been a pleseant surprise this year, riding a big upset against in-state rival Louisville.  Georgia Tech, of course, loves to run the ball with the triple-option offense.  This game can go either way, but I'll pick <strong>Kentucky</strong> to win a close game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Outback Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Florida vs. Iowa</p>
        <p>January 2nd</p>
        <p>You can forget about scoring in this game, as neither Florida nor Iowa are high-scoring teams.  Iowa always seems to play in the Outback Bowl, so I'm not quite sure how motivated they are in this one.  I'm picking <strong>Florida</strong> to win this game.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic</strong></p>
        <p>Western Michigan vs. Wisconsin</p>
        <p>January 2nd</p>
        <p>The Cotton Bowl will have the most compelling matchup as Group of 5 winner Western Michigan, who finished the regular season undefeated, gets their reward by playing in the Cotton Bowl in the biggest game of their school's history, playing against Wisconsin.  The Broncos beat two Big Ten teams en route to an unbeaten season, but Wisconsin is far better defensively than Northwestern and Illinois.  But that's not an excuse to sleep on Western Michigan.  Zach Terrell has done a great job this season at the QB position, which has been Wisconsin's weak point, shuffling between Alex Hornibrook and Bart Houston at QB.  But a running game led by Corey Clement has carried Wisconsin throughout the season.  Meanwhile, Western Michigan Wide Receiver Corey Davis is now the all-time NCAA leader in receiving yards.  There's plenty to like about this matchup, but defense wins, so while I'm rooting for Western Michigan to pull the upset, I have to pick <strong>Wisconsin</strong> to win.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Rose Bowl Game Presented by Northwestern Mutual</strong></p>
        <p>USC vs. Penn State</p>
        <p>January 2nd</p>
        <p>Maybe the two hottest teams not named Alabama play in the Rose Bowl as USC plays surprise Big Ten Champion Penn State.  If not for early season struggles, these two teams could've played in the Playoffs, but will have to settle for a Rose Bowl bid, which seemed improbable for Penn State this season.  With everything that's happened with their awful Sandusky scandal, is nothing short of a miracle for them to recover so quickly.  The Cheaters of course, lost badly to Alabama 52-6 to begin the season, ending up 1-3 before winning out the season with QB Sam Darnold.  Penn State may have the best QB-RB combo with Trace McSorley and Saquon Barkley and have looked very impressive.  But will that hot streak continue with all that time off?  With that said, there's definitely no way I can't pick <strong>Penn State</strong> to win this game.</p>

        <p>Auburn vs. Oklahoma</p>
        <p>January 2nd</p>
        <p>For all the talk about the SEC being the best conference in college football, it should be noted that besides unbeaten Alabama, the next best team is 8-4 Auburn.  Turns out, the SEC is overrated, and it will show here in the Sugar Bowl.  Oklahoma, who won the Big XII but wasn't seriously considered as a Playoff team due to two nonconference losses to Houston and Ohio State, have the best QB-WR combo in the country, with Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook, both of whom are Heisman finalists.  The Sooners have a chip on their shoulder, that's why I'm picking <strong>Oklahoma</strong> to beat Auburn easily.</p>

        <p><strong>College Football Playoff semifinal at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Washington vs. Alabama</p>
        <p>December 31st</p>
        <p>The big games, of course, are the Playoff games.  The first playoff game is between unbeaten Alabama and Washington.  The Crimson Tide, with their elite defense, and dynamic offense led by freshman QB Jalen Hurts, have clearly been the best team in the nation from the start to the finish of the season.  I certainly don't like Alabama, but yet, they have dominated this season.  Their closest margin of victory came against Ole Miss, a team that has given Alabama fits the past few years.  Yet Alabama beat them 48-43, needing a comeback to win that game.  Washington, of course, is always a rival of Oregon's, and they finally beat the Ducks, emphatically with an embarrassing 70-21 win.  It also stings to wonder what would have happened if Oregon had at least tried to hire Chris Petersen as their coach.  He's a great coach, and losing Steve Sarkisian to USC was the best thing to ever happen to the Huskies.  Washington has been great all season offensively and defensively, but their only loss was to USC, whose defense has improved since they got whomped by Alabama.  Alabama's defense is far better than USC's will ever be, which is why <strong>Alabama</strong> will return to the National Championship game.</p>

        <p><strong>College Football Playoff semifinal at the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl</strong></p>
        <p>Ohio State vs. Clemson</p>
        <p>December 31st</p>
        <p>The other semifinal game, between Ohio State and Clemson, appears to be more evenly matched.  Both teams have been great on the defensive side of the ball.  Yet their offense, at times, have appeared to be inconsistent, especially Ohio State.  They each lost one game by a field goal or less, with Penn State beating Ohio State by 3 and Pittsburgh beating Clemson by 1.  Each of them beat some pretty tough teams.  Clemson has wins against Auburn, Florida State and Louisville, while Ohio State beat the likes of Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Michigan.  The two teams are evenly matched and either one can win, but who has the edge.  I'm giving the slight edge to DeShaun Watson and <strong>Clemson</strong> for having a more consistent quarterback.  JT Barrett has been great for the Buckeyes but yet their offense hasn't been nearly as dynamic as it was two years ago when the won the National Championship with Ezekiel Elliott and company.</p>

        <p><strong>College Football Playoff National Championship</strong></p>
        <p>Washington/Alabama vs. Ohio State/Clemson</p>
        <p>January 9th</p>
        <p>I've obviously predicted a rematch of last year's National Championship game between the two teams.  The difference this time is that Alabama is unbeaten and Clemson has the one loss, a role reversal to say the least.  But Clemson is a little worse than last year, while Alabama is a little better.  I'll go more in depth when the actual matchup arises, but right now, I don't see anyone capable of beating <strong>Alabama</strong>.</p>
