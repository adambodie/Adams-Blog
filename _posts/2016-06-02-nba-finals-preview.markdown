intro: "The NBA Finals have arrived, featuring as I expected, a rematch of last year's Finals, Golden State vs. Cleveland.  Last year, Cleveland, despite missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, played their hardest, gave Golden State a legitimate scare before Golden State was able to win their first championship in 40 years.  Things have changed slightly this year, with the aforementioned Irving and Love healthy this time around, while Golden State, with not much change, finished with an NBA record 73 wins in the regular season.  So who wins the rematch?  Here are my thoughts."

</div>
	<p>Golden State has the same core from last year, but improved their offensive output considerably to a record 73 wins.  Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are capable of hitting a barrage of three pointers at any time, while Draymond Green took the leap from stud to All-Star, a matchup nightmare for any team, Cleveland included.  Golden State is not perfect by any means, needing to overcome a 3-1 deficit to beat Oklahoma City in the Western Conference Finals, but at their best, Golden State is difficult to stop.</p>
	<p>Cleveland, on the other hand, has looked unstoppable as of recent, albeit with a weaker group of opponents.  Tyronn Lue, who took over the head coaching position from fired David Blatt, has implemented a more up-tempo game and Cleveland has clearly flourished under this style of play.  Their offensive game somewhat matches Golden State’s with their shooting capabilities.  Mid season acquisition Channing Frye has been hitting threes; his presence may be Cleveland’s wild card.</p>

		<h4>Still the same old LeBron James</h4>
</div>
	<p>Defensively, Golden State still has last year’s Finals MVP Andre Iguodala to guard LeBron James.  I would imagine Iguodala will start in the Finals since his addition to the starting lineup last year propelled Golden State to the MVP.  Draymond Green was defensive player runner up and will likely guard Kevin Love, whose range likely makes it easier for LeBron and others to attack the rim.  Cleveland on the flip side has LeBron leading the way defensively, while Tristan Thompson will be responsible for cleaning up the boards.  I expect this series will be decided by small ball, rendering Andrew Bogut useless.  Does Timofey Mozgov even play much time anymore?  I’m not sure he even does.</p>
	<p>One thing that could tip the series is Draymond Green’s technical foul watch.  With six already in the postseason, one more will trigger a one-game suspension.  He must try to keep his emotions down, which is not easy for anyone with his tenacious style of play.  He struggled a bit against Oklahoma City, and needs to play his best, as he’s the ultimate X-Factor and arguably the heart of the team, the player that makes Golden State truly out of this world.</p>

</div>
	<p>Both teams live by the three and die by the three.  Ultimately, this is what the series will come down to.  Curry and Thompson are the top two shooters in the game right now, finishing 1-2 in the regular season in three-pointers made.  Cleveland has players that can stretch the floor out and hit threes as well, Irving, Love, J.R. Smith and Frye are capable of getting hot from the three-point line.  Whichever team can defensively play the best will ultimately win the NBA Championship.  While Cleveland will give Golden State everything they got, I expect a hard fought series going to the Warriors in Seven Games.  For Finals MVP, I’ll go out on a limb and predict Klay Thompson as Finals MVP.  He saved the Warriors in Game 6 against Oklahoma City and arguably more difficult to stop since Cleveland will focus more on stopping Steph Curry.</p>
