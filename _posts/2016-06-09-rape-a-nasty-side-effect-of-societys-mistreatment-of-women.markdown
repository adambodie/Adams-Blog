intro: "Much buzz on the news is about a rapist name Brock Turner, a former Stanford swimmer who raped an unconscious woman and received just six months in prison for it, despite being convicted of three felony sexual assault charges.  Though the defendant claims he understands what he did was wrong, he has managed to show how little responsibility he has actually taken for his crimes, feeling like he is the victim just as much as the woman he raped. Cases like this show just how little regard some men have for women in general and how that, more than anything, leads to rape."

	<p>Blame it on the Alcohol. Many young college kids love to drink alcohol, even when they're not supposed to.  There's nothing anyone can do to stop that.  But drunken frat parties and binge drinking don't always led to rape.  Nor does it give anyone a reason to act like it's the woman's fault for getting raped because she was drunk and made bad decisions.  No one ever shames the man when he gets drunk and makes bad decisions.  Brock Turner had no problem blaming his actions on the alcohol, as if once you're drunk, you're incapable of making a decision.  That is not the truth.  You own your decisions whether you're drunk or not.  And Brock Turner chose to rape a woman while she was unconscious.  He chose to flee when two men stopped him from his attack.  These are actions of someone who chose to make a horrible decision, not someone who is incapable of making a decision. It's not the alcohol's fault.  Surely, there's something else that contributes to rape by a drunk man.</p>
	<p>Blame it on the Culture.  Young college kids are learning to be adults for the first time in their lives.  They often act irresponsibly with frats, sororities and anything that involves partying in general.  But people have a choice to do those things.  I never did in college, and many other people often say no.  Brock Turner felt he had to go after women no matter the cost.  He claims peer pressure made him do it.  But is it worth the so-called peer pressure when you know what you're doing is wrong.  It's not culture that leads to rape.  It's those who make the decision to rape that leads to rape.  After all, party culture does not equal rape culture.</p>
	<p>Blame it on the Victim.  Of course, if a woman is flirting and sending you signs that she wants you, you have to say yes no matter what happens.  Brock Turner claims she started it, that she wanted to have sex with him, that is was all consensual.  Problem was, the woman was unconscious.  Nowhere in Brock Turner's version of events did it mention that the woman was unconscious.  Sure, if a woman suggests sex at that time, you can have sex at the time.  But try asking her if she's unconscious.  If the answer is not yes, it's not consensual, end of story.  If a woman says no, it's not consensual, end of story.  If a woman says nothing, it's not consensual, end of story.  It's not the victim that leads to rape. It's the perpetrator alone who makes that decision.  Otherwise, it's consensual.</p>

	<p>So where does the blame lie?  Misogynistic attitudes towards women is the primary cause.  Men who see women as objects, as if it's a game to win their heart, without any emotional feelings for their emotions or well being.  These are the types of attitudes that rapists have.  Men like Brock Turner, whom prosecutors argued in court made numerous attempts inappropriately seeking out women, touching them in the wrong places, being way too persistent.  If anyone felt for a woman's feelings and needs, they would be respectful and leave them alone if said woman was not interested.  Real men treat women with respect, care about their feelings, and wouldn't have sex with a woman without her consent.  But for men with misogynistic attitudes and masculine superiority, it often becomes all about power and domination over the 'lesser' sex, as if it's all about them.   For many, rape is an aggressive culmination of this type of behavior, and until society figures out how to reverse this type of behavior, it's never going to stop.  That's why when these type of people get drunk, their attitude towards women is fully realized, as their inhibition telling them what they're doing is illegal and wrong goes out the window.  It's not the alcohol, it's their attitude unleashed.  Brock Turner didn't have the slightest bit of respect for that woman, and still doesn't.  Blaming everyone and everything else but himself doesn't fix anything.</p>
	<p>It's wrong for men to believe that women are at fault, or that their feelings don't matter.  For some, like Brock Turner's Dad, it's his son who has to live with all the suffering and embarrassment, not thinking for one second about the victim, or that the fact that his son committed a felony crime by raping an unconscious woman.  What might seem to be '20 minutes' is never forgotten by the victim; they have to live with that forever.  But with people like Dan Turner, a slap on the wrist is all that rapists need because it's 'just one mistake'.  If only the victim got a slap on the wrist.  But she didn't.  She was raped.  Maybe if he thought about her feelings, he might've second guessed the things he said.  Because it's not 'just one mistake,' it's a crime.</p>
	<p>The legal system is supposed to help the victims.  But sometimes, they turn a blind eye, often times blaming the victim, or assuming felony rape is not worthy of such a long sentence because the perpetrator is supposed to be an outstanding citizen (when he's clearly not for raping a woman).  The Judge who sentenced Brock Turner to 6 months in prison spent his time talking about not wanting to ruin his life.  It's not about his life.  It's not about his future.  It's about justice for the woman.  The Judge deserves to be fired for his lenient sentence.  It's as if a felony didn't happen.  Aren't felonies supposed to land you at least one year in prison?  Again, had the judge listened to what the woman went through, he would've seen things differently, rather than believing the perpetrator was the actual victim.</p>
	<p>The sad truth is that our society bashes women to some level; whether it's a Presidential candidate calling women fat pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals, bimbos and bleeding out of 'you know where,' a judge who ignores a woman's plea for justice, focusing on protecting the rapist himself, or those who call women sluts every time they have too much to drink and have sex but don't make such remarks about men.  This problem is much bigger than Brock Turner.  It happens everywhere, college universities, businesses, you name it.  Women need to be heard, to speak up and fight back.  This brave woman let the world know how she felt, and her words are nothing short of powerful and honest.  Having just read what she had to write, all I can say is thank you for standing up and speaking out.  We need more people as brave as her, as heroic as the two men who stopped the rape, and less people like the rapist who pretends to care but blames everyone but himself.  It's time we stop focusing on the bad people and focus on the good ones.</p>
