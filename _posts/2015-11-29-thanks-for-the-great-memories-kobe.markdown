intro: "When I was 11 years old, I liked to get NBA jerseys.  I loved the sport and thought it was cool to wear them.  Some of them I bought for the design, like Grant Hill's Detroit Pistons jersey with the horse logo (what would you expect, I was young and loved the animal logos, even the Toronto Raptors Dinosaur logo which, like Detroit's logo then looked hideous by today's standards).  Others were for my local team that I liked growing up, the Portland Trail Blazers, that of the great Arvydas Sabonis.  I even got a throwback jersey of Dr. J from the Philadelphia 76ers.  But there's one jersey which I still have to this day as a collector item, a rookie jersey of Kobe Bryant."

	<h4>One of the All-Time Greats, and Laker for Life: Kobe Bryant</h4>
</div>



<p>As a young'un, I followed basketball immensely, studying players stats, schools and heights down to the core.  There wasn't anything I didn't know from the 90's.  I can even tell you that Alaa Abdelnaby had a career game when I had surgery on my ears when I was six years old.  Why would I remember that?  Who knows.  But reading articles and whatever I could get my hands on, I became drawn to a kid that came straight out of high school in 1996, a kid named Kobe Bryant.  I don't know why I thought so highly of him as a rookie; he was young, raw and untested for the big game, coming off the bench and hitting airballs on occasion, yet Kobe won the Slam Dunk contest, which was a favorite of mine.</p>

<p>So as I think of what to write, I reminisce over twenty years in the NBA for Kobe, from the highs to the lows, as Kobe announced today that this season will be his last.  I expected from the beginning that this would be his last season, after all, he hasn't been able to stay healthy the past few seasons, and especially this season, can't take it anymore.  Little did I know when I was 11 that Kobe would become arguably the best player of his generation, which for my definitional purposes is from 1998, when Michael Jordan retired from the Chicago Bulls for a second time in 1998, to 2010, when LeBron James joined the Miami Heat (and the last year Kobe and the Lakers won the NBA title).</p>

<p>As a young kid, my favorite team was the Portland Trail Blazers, since I lived in Portland, but at times I also liked the Los Angeles Lakers, since I had my relatives in L.A.  Though I was more of a Blazer fan due to their proximity, things began to change when the Lakers acquired Kobe Bryant from a trade in the 1996 NBA Draft from the Charlotte Hornets from Vlade Divac (whom was expendable as the Lakers signed Shaquille O'Neal to a monster deal that summer).  During the first two years of Kobe's career, I found myself more and more torn over who to root for.  On the one hand, the Blazers will still my local team, but the great lovable players of the era, i.e. Clyde Drexler, Jerome Kersey and Terry Porter were replaced with talented but malcontent players, i.e. Damon Stoudamire, Rasheed Wallace and the worst of them all, Isaiah Rider.</p>

<p>It became more difficult for me to root for Portland when hearing about all the Blazers run-in's with the law, and the general manager Bob Whitsitt who did little to stop it.  I also had a difficult time when the Playoffs came and the Lakers and Blazers would face off in the first round of the Playoffs.  I wasn't the type to root for both teams, going back and forth.  That might fit my Uncle Mike, the San Francisco 49ers/Seattle Seahawks fan, but not for me.  By the time I was fourteen, I knew I had to root for one team, and toss aside the other.  Having been drawn into Kobe's potential, I chose the Lakers over the Blazers.</p>

<p>Sure, the Lakers had a big star at the time, Shaq, and he was a unique player that in his prime, no one could ever stop.  But yet I found myself more into Kobe's demeanor and personality than anything else.  I also loved Kobe's little fro when he was young.  I was surprised when he shaved it off, and began to look like Michael Jordan, but I outgrew that and can't imagine Kobe without the shaved head.  Talent wise, Kobe became an elite player thanks to Phil Jackson.</p>

<p>Phil Jackson, perhaps the best coach in NBA history, won six championships with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, so when he took over in LA, expectations went through the roof, and without a doubt they were met.  Centered around Shaq, but also getting a lot of production of Kobe, the Lakers won the first of three championships in 2000.  To this day, I can't think of a better NBA moment than in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and the Blazers, when Kobe threw up the alley-oop to Shaq to ice a fifteen-point deficit in the fourth quarter.  Though many knew Shaq was the best player on the team, an unstoppable force of size and strength, people like me knew that Kobe's efforts weren't for lost, and that Shaq needed Kobe just as much as Kobe needed Shaq.</p>

</div>



<p>The next year the Lakers dominated, sweeping everyone in the Western Conference and losing only once in the NBA Finals to the Philadelphia 76ers (arguably due to a long layover).  But Kobe proved time and time again that when the Lakers needed a clutch shot in the fourth quarter, that Kobe was the man to do it.  And that continued into 2002, when the Lakers won their third straight Championship, needing every bit of Kobe to get past the Sacramento Kings in the Western Conference Finals.  But despite having the talented duo of Shaq and Kobe, it would not last forever.</p>

<p>There's no denying Kobe and Shaq were both 'Alpha-Dogs,' capable of leading a team to greatness.  Unfortunately, neither one was willing to back down and wanted to be the 'Sidekick,' which led to the duo not on good terms.  Kobe also faced sexual-assault charges in the summer 2003 from an encounter in Eagle, Colorado.  I was upset having heard the charges, but yet believed the allegations were not true having heard more details.  I don't know what happened that night, but one thing I do know looking back, is that Kobe learned from his mistake and never faced any additional troubles.  By 2004, after the Lakers lost the NBA Finals to Detroit despite adding legends like Karl Malone and Gary Payton, things were about to change for Kobe.</p>

<p>With Kobe becoming a free agent, and knowing him and Shaq would not ever co-exist together, the Lakers decided to keep Kobe and make him the star of the team, trading Shaq to the Miami Heat.  It was sad to see Shaq go, but being a fan of Kobe, I began disliking Shaq and all the negative comments he would make about Kobe to the public.  Sure, Kobe made his comments behind closed doors, but with Shaq's outgoing personality, it seemed overkill on his part.  It took a few years but I eventually forgave Shaq, but at the time, it was all Kobe for me.</p>

<p>Without Shaq, Kobe's game was never better.  In fact, when reached his prime, he was an amazing player to watch, hitting impossible shot after impossible shot.  Players like Shane Battier and Bruce Bowen, amongst the best defenders to take on Kobe, would defend him perfectly, but yet Kobe was still capable of draining a jump shot with them in his face.  And how could I forget the infamous 'Kobe Stopper' Ruben Patterson, and how Kobe got him to stop using such a ridiculous nickname after Kobe made some nearly impossible shots against him.  But during his prime, Kobe had to take care of things himself, as the perfectionist and willing to win at all costs Kobe would do.  One particular night, January 29, 2006, stands out for Kobe, as he did the unthinkable and scored 81 points.  The game wasn't on TV, but seeing all the highlights left me in awe.  There were plenty of scoring outbursts for Kobe, including one game against Dallas where he outscored them 62-61 through three quarters in a game, but the 81-point game was special, as only Wilt Chamberlin's famous 100 point game ranks higher.</p>

<p>By 2007, I reached a crossroads with Kobe, as did he.  He began anew by changing his number from 8 to 24.  It was difficult to get used to at first, but now I see Kobe as both 8 and 24. Tired of losing, Kobe demanded out of LA.  Unable to win consistently and often paired with unreliable players, i.e. Smush Parker, Kobe showed his mean side and began complaining about the Lakers and trying his best to get out, targeting the young and untested Andrew Bynum as trade bait.  It certainly showed Kobe's unlikability, but yet I understood his frustrations.  I openly pondered whether I would root for the Lakers or follow Kobe to Chicago or wherever he wound up.  I had no problem tossing Shaq aside, but Kobe was different.  Thankfully, I never had to make that decision, as midway through the 2008 season, the Lakers got the sidekick Kobe desperately needed, the talented forward of the Memphis Grizzlies, Pau Gasol.  The two would hit if off and push the Lakers to title contenders once again.</p>

<p>Having Pau Gasol definitely helped Kobe out, and made Kobe a better player and more mature.  Gone were the complaints to the media about being traded, no more criticism of Phil Jackson, whom molded Kobe to be the great player he was.  In a way, it made Kobe more likable to me, because at times Kobe was immature, like any young player.  And through all in all, Kobe fought every step of the way to contribute, sacrificing his health to win now.  Thanks to Pau Gasol and others, the Lakers won NBA titles in 2008 and 2010.  They lost the Finals in 2009 to Boston but got their revenge, beating out their longtime rivals in one of the most hard thought series ever played.  Haters want to criticize Kobe for winning the Finals MVP that year, but that was such a defensive struggle that no one really deserved it, but they had to give it to someone.  Game 7 struggles don't mean anything.</p>

<p>Things began to change, as the Lakers took a step back and Phil Jackson retired.  Once again, the Lakers shook things up, acquiring Dwight Howard and Steve Nash in separate deals.  Neither of these deals worked out, as Kobe butted heads with Dwight Howard, who couldn't handle Kobe's passion to win and hard work to do so, while Steve Nash couldn't stay healthy.  Even more puzzling was the Lakers decision to hire Mike D'Antoni as head coach, over Phil Jackson, who was interested in coming back a third time.  It was at the end of the 2012 season when Kobe started to show cracks in the armor, when he tore his achilles towards to end of the season.  Unfortunately, Kobe's career was never the same, as he couldn't stay healthy and his body started breaking down.</p>

<p>Kobe poured his heart and soul for basketball, doing whatever it took to play.  His determination to do whatever it took has caught up with Kobe.  Was he going to take things steady like Tim Duncan, who sacrificed his dominance for a longer career and more championship opportunities?  Heck no.  Did he want to 'just have fun' like Dwight Howard?  Not even remotely possible.  Nor did he try to form a Big Three thinking it was make for easier titles like LeBron?  Try again.  No longer can Kobe hit the shots.  Gone are the days of Kobe dunking with power and athleticism.  It's sad that Kobe will retire, but his body won't get younger anytime soon.  He's played in the NBA for 20 years, racking up numerous awards, honors and titles.  Plenty of people hate him for his personality, his determination, or off-putting attitude, but yet they all know Kobe was one of the greatest in his era.  It's unfortunate it had to end like this, and quite sad how poorly Kobe's playing.  But now's the time to take the farewell tour, bask in the glory and honor a great career.  Thanks for the memories.</p>
