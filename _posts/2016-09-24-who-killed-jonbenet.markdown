intro: "Twenty years ago, the night after Christmas, six year old JonBenét Ramsey was found murdered in her home, in what has become a bizarre and fascinating case, from the rambling ransom note to the suspicion on the family, there are many odd things about the case that makes it unusual.  Yet after 20 years, no one really knows what happened.  Recently, a new investigator team, with new technology, reanalyzed the evidence and discussed their findings on a CBS special.  So with that all said, who killed JonBenét Ramsey?  Here are all my possible theories, complete with their likelihood of it happening."

<ol>
<li>John Mark Karr killed her.  He confessed to the crime, but no evidence linked him to it.  The likelihood that he killed her:  0%</li>
<li>Burke Ramsey accidentally killed her.  Burke Ramsey, now 29, recently talked to Dr. Phil about the case, and he came across as socially awkward.  And despite the parents claim he was asleep at the time they called 911, a young voice was heard on the phone after Patsy thought she hung up the phone (she didn't) with updated technology, possibly saying “What did you find?”  I doubt a nine year old would intentionally kill his little sister, but if he was awake, why didn't they make that claim to begin with when he could’ve been awake without committing a crime?  In order for this theory to be true, someone needed to cover the crime, which his parents would have every reason to do.  Clearly, the ransom note was not written by Burke.  But at the same time, he apparently had a temper and hit her on the head with a golf club when she was four.  But that's not indicative of a killer; he was too young to understand.  They also found two dots on her back that might have matched train tracks, which he could’ve used, but doesn’t necessarily mean he did use them.  Also found at the scene was a bowl of pineapple and tea with Burke’s fingerprints, which becomes significant because JonBenét had undigested pineapple in her intestine when they found her.  It’s possible Burke hit her in the head with the flashlight over a pineapple squabble; the flashlight head perfectly fit the skull fracture they found, but it’s not the only reason to accidentally kill someone and anyone could’ve used it.  The likelihood of Burke killing her accidentally: 35%</li>
<li>Patsy Ramsey killed her.  Two theories tie in to this scenario.  One: she got in a fit of rage, and two: she was mad at her husband and wanted him to pay for it.  The police had her submit five writing samples as they suspected she wrote the ransom note due to similar handwriting and found her fingerprints on the pad and pen.  The new investigators analyzed the note and believe a woman wrote it based on the language.  Her 911 call was incredibly off, as her apparent grief seemed fake, especially with the conversation overheard accidentally showed her incredibly calm.  And her and John refused to talk to the police for a while, not to mention the fact they had friends over while the crime scene was being investigated.  That in itself is a sign of trying to destroy evidence.  Something was never right with Patsy, and while it’s true she pushed JonBenét with all the pageantry stuff, it is possible she snapped from various reasons, whether it was jealousy or perfectionism.   The likelihood of Patsy killing her: 40%</li>

<li>John Ramsey killed her.  John Ramsey acted weird, running straight for the basement when the police told him they needed to search the house top to bottom.  And he planned to leave shortly after they found JonBenét deceased.  That seems a bit odd, but wouldn't explain the ransom note that made him the target.  At the very least, he was involved in the so-called cover-up.  The likelihood he killed her: 5%</li>
<li>Patsy Ramsey hired someone to kill her.  The DNA found on JonBenét’s body did not match her immediate family.  That ruled them out as official suspects, but that doesn't mean they weren't involved in her death.  Assuming Patsy wrote the note, she could have had someone enter the house to kill JonBenét, but if money was the object, why wasn't she actually kidnapped?  Perhaps a struggle ensued and the hired killer took things too far by striking her while Patsy wrote the ransom note.  On the other hand, the broken glass theory seemed unlikely, someone probably would've heard it and cobwebs were found intact, as the window was allegedly broken by John months prior.  There was no break-in, so someone else who may have entered the house had to have been let in.  It makes no sense for them to enter through the basement window based on the evidence.  Patsy is the most likely to do this.  The lack of footprints outside in the snow is harder to get explain under this theory, but everything else potentially works.  The probability of Patsy hiring someone to kill her: 15%</li>
<li>John Ramsey hired someone to kill her.  It’s highly unlikely that this is a possibility as John Ramsey had little motive to kill JonBenét, but you never know, he could've had a double life and seeked an escape, but that would require killing the whole family.  The likelihood of John hiring someone to kill her: 2%</li>
<li>A complete stranger killed her.  There are plenty of sexual predators out there, and one of them could've easily slipped in the door and committed the crime.  Of course, without no forced entry, the only way this is possible is if the door was unlocked.  Otherwise, there would've been evidence of a break-in.  But anything is possible.  There are plenty of people that would have had an unhealthy lust for her since she was in beauty pageants all prettied up.  But why write a ransom note inside with the exact amount of John’s bonus?  Who knew that number besides the family itself.  And since the ransom note suggests a cover-up, why cover up a complete stranger.  The likelihood of a complete stranger killing her: 10%</li>

<p>There are a lot of things to consider when making the determination as to who killed JonBenét.  There was no break-in or footprints (they found one but not conclusive), which highly suggests the killer was already in the house.  Though it’s possible a stranger found a key and entered the house without a break-in, it doesn't completely explain the ransom note.  A true ransom note wouldn't have been written as long nor on pad of paper found in the house.  Even more damaging to the legitimacy of the ransom note was that JonBenét was found dead in the basement.  That's not a kidnapping.  This further suggests that her killer was one of her family members.  But which member was it?  Burke, Patsy or John?</p>
<p>There’s little evidence to conclude that John Ramsey was the killer.  The ransom note was targeted at him and didn't sound like he wrote it.  He appears to be a family loving businessman and nothing else.  The motive isn't there.  That just leaves Patsy and Burke as the two most likely perpetrators.  Both had the ability to kill JonBenét, whether intentional or not.   There’s certainly a reason to believe a cover up occurred, as a grand jury voted to indict John and Patsy for charges related to her murder, but ultimately the DA declined to press charges.  But who had more of a motive to have a crime covered up?</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons to believe Burke was the killer.  He acted bizarre over the whole ordeal, and his parents apparently lied about him being asleep at the time they called 911.  They spent their lives protecting him and wanting him to have a normal life.  Plus with a tendency to have a temper, it was possible to hit her in a rage.  It would perfectly explain the ransom note as a means to bring attention away from him.  But at the same time, any awkwardness shown in his psychiatry visits doesn’t necessarily suggest that said awkwardness was due to killing her.  Maybe he witnessed the attack that left JonBenét Ramsey dead, and the reason the parents said he was asleep was to keep him from testifying.  That is also possible. </p>
<p>To me, the most likely suspect is Patsy Ramsey.  The way she acted during the 911 call was not what you'd expect from someone who lost a child.  She sounded too calm and likely would've shown a tad more emotion if it was Burke rather than herself.  She pushed JonBenét hard with the pageantry and perhaps got jealous of the attention she received and snapped.  She invited friends over while police were investigating the crime scene and wouldn't speak to the police, speaking to CNN first.  Even then, the way she spoke of JonBenét after she died struck me as someone who killed her, rather than someone protecting her son who killed her.  She said things like “I loved that child,” which lacks empathy to me.  John Ramsey was a loving husband and would’ve easily protected his wife if said attack was not intentional.  There certainly are problems with this theory, but it makes more sense than Burke being the killer.  Sure, Burke was weird, and still is weird, but he could've always been like that.  He appeared to be jealous of the attention JonBenét got, but that didn’t mean he actually killed her.  Plus, he was nine years old.  He would’ve never been criminally charged with her death, as he was too young.  But Patsy would’ve faced murder/manslaughter charges if she was in fact the killer.  She would’ve face prison time and that would’ve destroyed the family fabric.</p>

<p>One thing for certain is that the family never wanted this case solved.  They used their money and influence to keep the investigation grounded, and did everything else to wipe out and destroy evidence.  Had the police officers and FBI had not messed up the initial investigation, chances are, the crime would’ve been solved 20 years ago.  In this essence, all three Ramsey’s were involved in her death and only have themselves to blame.  Protecting themselves at the expense of JonBenét is sad.  </p>
