intro: "It’s true what they say, Kobe always know how to put on a show. The second half of his final game was no exception. As I watched Kobe take shot after shot after shot, I wondered if he was really trying to reach 50 points. The announcers mentioned that could be the case in the first quarter. I would have been happy with 40 points. The plan was to sit Kobe the first half of the fourth quarter. That didn’t happen. Suddenly, the race to 50 was on."

<p>For a man who was always told to pass the ball, in this game, everyone was passing the ball to him and telling him to shoot.  And he did, repeatedly.  No wonder I mentioned Marcelo Huertas in the first part of the blog multiple times.  As the game drew closer to the end, Kobe kept making shots, and with some nice dunks from Larry Nance Jr. and some other great plays, the crowd was going nuts.  Then Kobe reached 51 point with a layup with under two minutes left.</p>

<p>Miraculously, the game was close and the Lakers actually had a chance to win it.  Down by 6, I jokingly thought to myself, ‘Kobe is aiming for 60 points, not 50.’  A couple of shots made later, he actually had a shot at that goal.  I was shocked, he looked tired, playing 42 minutes at 37 years old, but Kobe has made a career of playing with lots of pain.  A few shots later and with Utah missing a bunch of shots, Kobe reached the free throw line with two free throws needed for 60.  He made them both easy-peasy, giving them a three point lead.  After a steal from Kobe on the next play, he threw it down court to Jordan Clarkson for the slam, putting the icing on the cake.  Kobe left the game for the last time with 4 seconds left as the Lakers won 101-96 in a thrilling game, finishing an incredible 60 point game.  Sure, Kobe took 50 shots, but it was his last game, so who cares.  Haters can hate.  A Nike commercial starring Kobe made that clear, he loves the hate, he feeds off the hate.  When it was all said and done, I stood up and applauded a fitting farewell for Kobe.</p>

<p>After the game, Kobe gave hugs to multiple former players (even the obscure former players from the past, Devean George, Chris Mihm, Ronni Turiaf and a plethora of others long forgotten, along with the big stars and his family).  After the balloons went down, Kobe got to address the fans one last time, thanking the fans, his journey playing twenty years for his favorite childhood dream, and honoring the bad years as his favorite for all the hard work and never giving up.  He ended his speech simply put ‘Mamba out.’  Close to how I ended my blog.</p>

<p>As I sit back and reflect on it all, it amazes me just how competitive Kobe was.  There was no other like him, he drove off the pain, the bad games, the fans jeering, it just made Kobe more determined.  The NBA will miss that for sure.  Too many players now want Super Teams to make it easy on themselves.  LeBron ran from the hard times, ran from home to play in Miami, only to realize it was a mistake despite winning two Championships and went back to Cleveland.  But instead of fighting through it, he complains.  No wonder Kobe’s had more success.  But that’s another subject to debate.  And of course, on the same night the Golden State Warriors won their 73rd win to break the single-season record, it’s Kobe who proved again who the real star was.</p>

<p>Where do the Lakers go from here?  How will it be for me rooting for them without the one constant they’ve had since I was 11?  This season was nothing more than the Kobe Farewell show, and they knew it.  They had their lowest wins in a season ever, even less than last year's worst season ever.  They have young talent, lots of cap room and hopefully a top three pick in the NBA Draft (here’s hoping they get the Number 1 pick).  But getting a high class free-agent will be almost impossible since there’s no one ready to be a superstar now.  They will need to build through the draft.  D’Angelo Russell showed potential to be a star; hopefully not having Kobe around will let him blossom.  He needs to mature both on and off the court, but Kobe wasn’t exactly great at 19 years old.  Jordan Clarkson is a solid player worth keeping, with both the heart and talent to succeed.  Julius Randle has some freakish talents but like Russell is quite young and not yet mature.  The rest of the team is give and take; Roy Hibbert is useless and off the books, won’t be back.  Nick Young is terrible for Byron Scott’s style of play (if Scott even remains as coach, not a given), and being secretly recorded by Russell for no good reason left him hurt.  Lou Williams is a nice bench player but would probably want a better team to play for.  Larry Nance Jr. showed nice energy and has great dunking abilities (like his dad).  No one else stands out in any way.</p>

<p>Now for a quick review of the NBA Season, from the highlights to the lowlights.  Here are my picks for MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, Rookie of the Year, Coach of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Most Improved, Surprising Team and Disappointing Team of this season.</p>

<p>The Rookie of the Year goes to the #1 pick Karl Anthony Towns of the Minnesota Timberwolves.  I admit, I was wrong about him.  He’s been a much better player than I thought.  He’s got potential with Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine to make the Minnesota Timberwolves relevant.  Also considered: Kristaps Porzingis of the New York Knicks, Devin Booker of the Phoenix Suns.</p>

<p>The Coach of the Year goes to Terry Stotts of the Portland Trail Blazers.  No one thought Portland would be any good after losing most of their key players, but with Damian Lillard leading the way and the rapid rise of CJ McCollum, Terry Stotts proved his worth as a coach, leading Portland to the #5 seed in the West with lesser talent than last year.  Also considered: Steve Kerr/Luke Walton of the Golden State Warriors (Walton of course filled in half of the season while Kerr was recovering from surgery), Brad Stevens of the Boston Celtics.</p>

<p>Sixth Man of the Year goes to Jamal Crawford of the Los Angeles Clippers.  Not a particularly strong year for sixth man, but Crawford has always filled the role quite well.  Also considered: Andre Iguadola of the Golden State Warriors, Will Barton of the Denver Nuggets.</p>

<p>Most Improved Player of the Year goes to CJ McCollum of the Portland Trail Blazers.  Loaded with lots of potential but not getting much of a chance, McCollum stepped into the role of Damian Lillard’s sidekick, exploding with a 20.8 points per game average, and keeping the Blazers out of rebuilding mode.  Also considered: Isaiah Thomas of the Boston Celtics, Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors.</p>

<p>Defensive Player of the Year goes to Kawhi Leonard of the San Antonio Spurs.  A defensive freak of nature and capable of guarding just about everyone, Kawhi Leonard knows how to lock players down.  The Spurs struck gold with him, go figure.  Also considered: Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors, Hassan Whiteside of the Miami Heat.</p>

<p>Surprising Team of the Year goes to the Portland Trail Blazers.  Considered an afterthought losing most of its core, Portland stayed afloat with the sudden rise of CJ McCollum.  Especially difficult in the Western Conference.  Also considered: Boston Celtics, Charlotte Hornets.</p>

<p>Disappointing Team of the Year goes to the Chicago Bulls.  Loaded with talent but seemingly missing something, they fired Tom Thibodeau and hired young coach Fred Hoiberg, hoping to improve.  Instead, the Chicago Bulls fell flat on their face and missed the playoffs all together.  A major shakeup needs to occur for the Bulls to be title contenders.  Also considered: New Orleans Pelicans, Washington Wizards.</p>

<p>MVP goes to Steph Curry. 30 points a game, 50% field goals made, 40% three pointers made (400 for the whole season), 90% free throws made and 73 wins.  Enough said.  Can anyone stop this guy?  He makes the craziest shots look so damn easy.  Can anyone else really be considered for MVP?  For the sake of being consistent, also considered: LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers and Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
