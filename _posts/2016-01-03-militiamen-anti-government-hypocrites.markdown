intro: "On January 2nd, 2016, a group of militiamen, led by Ammon Bundy, the son of famed anti-government law breaking tax cheat Cliven Bundy, took over a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon.  Though Burns is on the other side of the state (and a completely different world than where I live), it's insulting that these idiots are fighting to 'save' two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, whom have accepted their faiths to report to prison for their crimes and it's even stupider that these anti-government wackos think that they can do whatever they want as long as they wave their guns and American flags in the name of freedom."

	<h4>The Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon.</h4>

<p>The U.S. Government is in charge of our country, and they have a right to protect their land as they see fit.  Whether it's preserving our precious landmarks or protecting endangered species, the government has a right to step in and keep people from destroying something of value.  Wildlife Refuges are built to protect animals, plants and other forms of non-human life.  Militiamen believe that all land is for the people and that they should be able to do whatever they want with it, but that is not how things work.</p>

<p>People can't break the laws, and doing something illegal or doing something where you aren't supposed to do said things is never justified in the name of 'fighting the government.'  It is still against the law.  The Hammonds started a fire on land that wasn't their land, and have done so multiple times.  Arson is a crime, and lighting fires to cover up other crimes is also unacceptable.  Anti-government wackos can act like the rules don't apply to them, but at the end of the day, if you're told you can't do something, don't do it.  That's why the ranchers have accepted their prison sentences and don't speak for the actions of these losers.</p>

<p>But like any anti-government group, they only fight a specific cause, often hiding behind the second amendment to protect themselves.  So clearly, they have no problem following the second amendment, understanding its purpose tooth and nail, but the other things they don't like, it doesn't matter if it's there or not, because they have a right to fight the government, and not the other way around (again, hypocritical).  It's ironic to think that an organization that is against the government is using laws written by the government to protect them, that all they have to do is wave their guns to keep the government away.   They're no different than any other criminal organization that threatens to shoot those who are after them if they try to bring them down, because they are domestic terrorists out to fight the government, breaking laws just to get their way.</p>

<p>It's a fight for them to get everything they want for nothing.  They illegally own land, yet refuse to pay taxes or fees on it, like Cliven Bundy has done for all these years.  So the militiamen can call it fighting all they want, I call it mooching off the government.  And yet they keep the government, like any other criminal organization, from arresting them by waving their guns.  Anyone who owns a home pays property taxes, regardless of whether the land is owned by the government or not.  Just because these people want to own land that's not theirs, doesn't mean that they can get it for nothing.</p>

<p>So at the end of the day, these idiots can claim that they can do as they please, that they can take whatever land they want, but the United States has a government in charge and able to protect what it feels needs to be protected, and they have laws designed to make sure people follow them and not brake them.  The ranchers have accepted it, the people of Burns understand it, but these militiamen with no connection to the city or state want to cause trouble for their own self-gain.</p>
