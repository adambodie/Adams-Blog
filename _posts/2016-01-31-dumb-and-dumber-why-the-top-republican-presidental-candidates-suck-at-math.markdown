intro: "Tomorrow is the official start of the 2016 Presidential Election process in the United States, with the Iowa Caucus deciding who becomes the first leader in the race. Although it's no guarantee the winner of the Iowa Caucus becomes the nominee (i.e Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012 on the Republican side), it does say something about each party in general. With all of that said, the top two ranked Republican candidates in Iowa, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have pushed the bounds on extremism and pure hatred. It's no wonder establish Republicans are actively concerned about these two winning the Republican nomination, as some Republicans are smarter than others."

<p>Their views are surprisingly similar, despite the different backgrounds.  Both are chronic liars, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, guns-for-everyone, white-only, religious-fanatic lunatics.  Most important, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are terrible at math, aiming to reach a small audience and hoping that alone will give them the presidency.  Seemingly unaware of the fact that the very minorities they ridicule, bash and dehumanize are rising at a much higher rate than the voter base they are aiming for, who are dwindling and aging at record numbers.  Clearly, these two candidates think that math is stupid and only for liberals.  But math is concrete and absolute.  It can not be denied.  So how do these two idiots continue to deny math's power?</p>

<p>Ted Cruz, who claims to be a genius and Ivy League student, was recently exposed as fraudulently informing prospective Republican voters that they are committing 'voting violations'.  This is not only ridiculously false, but clearly an act of fraud.  Ted Cruz's philosophy appears to be committing scams to get people to vote (for him, of course).  Similar to the IRS and other law enforcement scams that alleged Nigerian princes commit, Ted Cruz has ignored all mathematical purities by claiming that only those likely to support him can vote.  This ignores all the Democrats, moderate Republicans, Libertarians and other third party non-Extremist Republicans right to vote.  Mathematically, they far outnumber the extremist Republicans Ted Cruz thinks are the only solemn citizens of America.  Chances are, Ted Cruz would send letters to minority Democrats claiming that their voting privileges are null and void stating bogus legal laws in an effort to suppress votes for those who would never vote for him.  Ted Cruz is a manipulative heartless unlikeable extremist who only cares about himself and no one else.  Basic math states that 40% of voters will vote Republicans, 40% will vote for Democrats and 20% are undecided, and Ted Cruz thinks he can win with only 10% of the pure Republican vote by scaring people into voting for him who can't stand him.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Donald Trump, the multi-billionaire business magnate, reality TV star and fraudulent businessman, also does not understand that simple math would change the trajectory of his campaign.  Donald Trump has spent his entire campaign bashing Hispanics, Blacks, Women, Muslims, Handicapped, Asians, Homosexuals, basically anyone who's not an old white religious man.  Despite all of this badmouthing, Donald Trump continues to insist that Hispanics, Blacks, Women, Muslims, Handicapped and Homosexuals all like him and will support him.  If I were a Hispanic, I would definitely not vote for someone who refers to people of my ethnicity as 'drug-dealers, criminals and rapists.'  Most Hispanics are not bad people, yet Donald Trump wants you to believe all of them are.  It is far more likely that Hispanics, whose population has increased far more than any other voting bloc would vote against him than vote for him.  But Donald Trump, the master manipulator who claims anyone can like him, must have a plan to attract undecided general voters.  It's true, lying flip-flops can easily act more moderate to appeal to moderate voters, but like Mitt Romney in 2012, this would make Donald Trump more untrustworthy.  It runs the risk of alienating the racist, white-supremacist-wannabe religious gun-toting extremists that pushed him to the top.  Those people would become disenfranchised that they voted for a former Democrat as their candidate.  Not all of them would abandon Trump, as Republicans will vote Republicans simply because they are Republicans, but enough would push the tide towards Hillary Clinton (or perhaps Bernie Sanders).</p>

<p>Emotions might propel many of the extremist conservative votes, those who are angry and fearful of what's happening in this country.  People have a right to be upset.  But ignoring mathematics has dire consequences, as the best way to truly accomplish things is by mixing your emotional feelings with mathematical realism.  Ted Cruz and Donald Trump may want you to think that math and science are unnecessary evils and try to manipulate numbers, but pure mathematics always win, and 53% will always be more than 47%.</p>
