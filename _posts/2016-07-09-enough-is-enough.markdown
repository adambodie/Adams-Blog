intro: "Enough is enough.  For so long, our country has turned a blind eye on racism, proclaiming that it's not a big deal like it used to be, just because of Civil Rights and the elimination of Jim Crow laws.  But recent events, particularly the deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas have shown just how horrific racism in the United States really is.  Is there a coincidence that this is happening now at this current time?  Of course not.  This is a by-product of the anger and race baiting politics that Donald Trump has shoved down America's throats."

	<p>Listen to Donald Trump speak.  Read between the lines with his stupid tweets.  Whatever the case be, Donald Trump is ANGRY.  He claims he wants to make America great again, but all he does is pit people against one another.  This type of hate-filled angst causes people to be angry and lack the ability to control their emotions.  A level-headed person is far more likely to make rational decisions than angry people whose emotions take control.  We don't need to hear the thoughts of the angry few.  Most people aren't like that.  And those who are angry with violent tendencies are often the ones who want to cause physical and mental harm to us.  This has been brewing for years with the racist minority openly complaining about Obama and his worldview.  The racists blame Obama for everything wrong, yet it's them who are making things worse.</p>
	<p>This happened in Baton Rouge, where Alton Sterling was shot dead by police multiple times while he was pinned to the ground by two officers.  A man who didn't deserve to die, yet too many times in these instances, regardless of race, the Officers always try to pin the victim as a 'criminal' for past convictions.  Doesn't matter.  Regardless of whether there was an altercation or not, it's not reasonable to shoot a man in the chest at point blank range if you have him pinned to the ground.  Clearly, hate for another leads to mistrust and violence.  The Police often blame those they kill as bad guys while the victims and their loved ones proclaim the Police and others as being overly aggressive due to their appearance.  Police hide behind their badge to justify their actions, rarely, if ever facing conviction for killing innocent people.  Black people often feel targeted for their skin color and sometimes act irrationally due to false accusations.  This hate needs will never stop while others on the sidelines encourage others to act by making these things solely a race issue.</p>
	<p>Too often people look solely at people's skin color and make judgments about them.  Some of it is blatant, while some of it is subconscious.  Some people may not realize it, but they are too focused on appearances when judging people.  This was clearly shown in the death of Philando Castile, who was pulled over in Falcon Heights, Minnesota for a 'broken tail-light.'  According to his girlfriend, who was seating next to him in the car, the Officer asked for license and registration (which is standard anytime someone gets pulled over, I know from personal experience), but then told him not to move the moment Philando mentioned having a gun.  No one who would want to shoot an Officer would openly tell them they're armed, but something must have clicked in the Officer's head, as suddenly he judged Philando Castile as 'a black man with a gun, he must be a gangster that wants to kill me,' rather than a complex human being who, contrary to those negative stereotypes, never had any trouble with the law.  This Officer had hate filled in his heart for whatever reason, and it led him to shoot Philando four times dead, while his girlfriend watched and cried in horror and recorded the aftermath.  No one deserves to die, especially over a 'broken tail-light.'  Even worse, the Officer and his backup showed no compassion for him or his girlfriend and 4 year old daughter in the car.  Instead, they watched him die, holding the gun pointed at him and arrested her.  Watching this video, it saddens me and only further supports my point.  The Officer was screaming, while the woman was shockingly calm yet upset.  That's not rational, that's anger for no reason.</p>
	<p>Yet instead of trying to heal the wounds, others loudly complain about the 'other side' playing the blame game.  These people will try to blame everyone else except the person who actually committed the crime.  They'll make them look like victims of the Government's views on society.  This is not a fantasy world, and only encourages more anger from those who feel like they're being targeted.  This is exactly what happened in Dallas, where Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25 year old African American and former Army reservist, angry with police officers for killing Alton and Philando (among others), set out to kill as many White police officers as he could.  Perhaps if someone had calmed him down and reminded him that most people were upset like he was and violence wasn't the answer, this may not have happened.  Instead, we had plenty of voices who have and continue to blame Blacks for their own deaths.  They get what they deserve.  They're only interested in killing cops.  These are the voices of the racist extremists that overshadow the compassionate majority.  To him, his actions were justified by the minority, which led him to murdering cops in anger.  None of this is okay for most, yet the hate filled few openly play race wars and hate games.</p>

	<p>As I read about the deaths in Dallas, it disgusts me that some blame the African American's and even Obama himself for all of this mess.  It's downright racist to believe that somehow because Obama is black, that he somehow supports a black man killing multiple police officers.  Obama referred to the shooting as a “vicious, calculated, despicable attack.”  Yet racist people like former congressman Joe Walsh, congressman Steve King, and media joke Sarah Palin don't even bother to listen to a single word he says.  I doubt any of these racist extremists believe anything Obama says is true.  They are part of the problem, not the solution.  This is not the time to declare 'war' against Obama and Black Lives Matter as former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh tweeted in the aftermath.   Nor is it the time to claim the Obama's own words have led to blacks only interested in killing cops, as racist Iowa congressman and Number 1 Hispanic Hater Steve King proclaimed (which isn't even remotely true, some cops do act 'stupidly,' they're human).  And last but not least, Sarah Palin, a clueless joke of a former Governor of Alaska who quit to become a famous media whore, her comments aren't even worth repeating.  After all, she's the type of person that would blame Obama for having a bad hair day.  Spewing more hate speech is not going to solve anything; it's only going to create more of the same type of behavior if not worse.</p>

	<p>This is not the time to say hurtful things that target African-Americans.  Nor is this the time to do the same against Police Officers.  Most African-Americans and Police Officers are good people.  In fact, saying hurtful things only encourages others to commit violence out of revenge, hate and spite.  It's not their fault any of this happens.  The problem is bigger than that.  So while most of America holds on to each other and comforts themselves, we are left to hear the voices of the extremists, who often complain the most and speak the loudest.  Unfortunately, our society notices negativity more than positivity as it attracts more attention.  Turn on the five o'clock news and dare to tell me that you will find anything positive on the news.  You might be lucky if you do, but most stories are the ones that resonate with viewers; the violence, the deaths, the rapes, the burglaries and the general hate we constantly hear about.  This is clear with those like Joe Walsh, who refuses to apologize for his opinions on Obama and the African American community, because to people like him, we can't blame the cops for anything, therefore, it's all the Blacks fault.</p>

	<p>So why does it seem that this is happening more commonly than it used to in the past?  There are a variety of factors, amongst them: easier access to news via social media, easier access to guns, especially with assault weapons no longer banned like they used to be, and more extremist behavior leading to a widespread feeling of anger.  This is abundantly clear with Donald Trump, whose words are frequently blasted over the web within seconds.  A man who hardly says anything positive, most people see the hate-filled spew coming out of his mouth, and it makes everyone angry and filled with hate.  His supporters are angry over minorities they believe are the problem with America.  His detractors are angry for targeting minorities and blaming them for everything.  This is not the voice of the American majority, yet this is all we hear about, leading people to have a narrow impression of America.  It's only the few hate-filled people with violent tendencies that end up causing physical and mental anguish, a task done easier with easy access with guns.  This is not what America is really like, we need to focus on the voices who want to heal, not the few who want to 'go to war.'  </p>
	<p>America is better than this.  We're all upset by this, as we should be.  But the best solution to heal our wounds is to come together, not tear us apart.  Focus on the love and compassion, not the hate and anger.  I know that not all people are fueled by hate, and most aren't like this.  It's up to the passionate majority to dismiss the viewpoints of the racist minority by speaking up.  This is not the time to deny that anything's wrong, nor to stay silent.  That only allows the Donald Trump's and Joe Walsh's of the world to convince us that they're the truth.  They're not the voice of the America I love and cherish.  These voices must be minimized through rejection of their bigoted ways.  Only then can the healing process begin.  Enough is enough.</p>
