intro: "Last year, I wrote about the Lakers season one week into the year, with much chagrin, as the Lakers took a while to win.  This season is a completely different story.  Would I call them a playoff team at this point?  Of course not, but there's a much different vibe this year."

<p>I would define the Lakers right now as a group of young ducklings.  Last season, it was all about Kobe's farewell show.  Now, it's more about the chase into seeing which of the young Lakers develops to be the next great one.  That to me is a good reason to watch these Lakers.  I don't have a favorite player, but rather a nice group of players that can mold into my favorite.  Right now, the Lakers are 2-3, having beating two of my least favorite players (and former teammates), James Harden (with Houston) and Dwight Howard (now with Atlanta).  Their win in Atlanta was impressive as road games, especially the last of four straight road games, coming back from a deficit.</p>
<p>One of my biggest questions of the Lakers drafting D'Angelo Russell last year was the development of equally talented guard Jordan Clarkson.  Fortunately, new coach Luke Walton found the perfect way to utilize him, as the team's sixth man.  Even better, Clarkson has accepted that role with good results so far.  The type of player the Lakers need.  I was surprised when I first learned of this, especially with Nick Young now the starting shooting guard.  There were doubts he'd even make the roster.  But it's easy to say his ex-girlfriend Izzy Azalea (ugh) was killing his career.  At the moment, it's been a good call, and Nick Young has improved, especially on the defensive end.</p>

<p>Tonight the Lakers return home to host the Golden State Warriors, now with Kevin Durant, wearing their throwback 1986-1987 champion Lakers jerseys.  Though the Warriors are obviously the better team right now, the Lakers are at home and Golden State had a hard fought matchup against Durant's former team.  But the Lakers did beat the Warriors in their last regular season game, rather convincingly.  Never say never.</p>
<p>The Lakers have a nice future ahead of them.  They've brought in some nice young players: D'Angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle.  They have nice veteran leaders in Luol Deng and Lou Williams.  Their bench is filled with energetic players, from the aforementioned Clarkson and Williams to Larry Nance Jr., whose dunking abilities perfectly describes his play.  They're missing a bonafide star, but Russell's in his second year and much improved from his rookie year when he was stuck with Kobe.  Brandon Ingram is a rookie and it will take him time.  We'll see if Randle or Clarkson can become All-Star's.</p>
