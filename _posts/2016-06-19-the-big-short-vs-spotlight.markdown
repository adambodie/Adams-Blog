intro: "I was asked to compare two recent movies and Oscar nominated and winning movies from this years Academy Awards.  The challenger on the left is The Big Short, which won Best Adapted Screenplay.  The champion on the right is Spotlight, which won Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.  So which movie did I think was better?  Here are my thoughts."

		<h4>Which movie should have won the Oscar?</h4>
</div>
	<p>Both movies are well done, featuring well known actors and are based on fairly recent events.  The Big Short, starring Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling, is based on the housing crisis that led to the recession, while Spotlight, starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams, is based on the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team uncovering the mass coverup of child sexual abuse by the numerous Catholic Priests in Boston (and all over the world).  Both have the realistic angle since the events actually happened (I’m not going to argue whether the facts are completely true, but that’s irrelevant at this point.  It’s not The Martian to say the least.  But their approach is quite different.</p>
	<p>One thing I really liked about The Big Short was its light-hearted approach.  Though the drama was there, it showcased some lightly comedic efforts in presenting the film.  With this approach, director Adam McKay, more known for comedy films, is able to reach a different audience for those who strictly like dramas.  In addition, scenes from various celebrities explaining some of the concepts presented in the film, such as CDO’s (consolidated debt organizations) and synthetic CDO’s.  I didn’t particularly know the celebrities that well and some of them seem odd to explain them (i.e. Selena Gomez, who was like 15 when the actual events happened), but it helped the audience better understand what exactly was going on.</p>
	<p>Spotlight, on the other hand, takes a more traditional approach of raw emotional storytelling.  Clearly, their story didn’t require that much explanation, so instead, director Tom McCarthy was able to focus on the story and emotions of the characters in the film.  The amount of detail featured in the investigation deserves praise.  Spotlight takes a safer route with its presentation, while The Big Short took a slightly less serious approach.</p>

	<p>The acting in The Big Short is well done, particularly Christian Bale’s role as Michael Burry, an eccentric hedge fund manager who looks like a slacker yet is able to determine the housing market is crumbling before anyone sees it.  Bale is well known for taking on a variety of roles and his extreme dedication to each role he takes, and his performance showcases this as he perfectly shows the slacker who’s quite intelligent yet dresses like a slob.  Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling also played their characters well, with Carell playing a hedge fund manager with distaste for the industry while Gosling plays a trader that’s cunning, smart and caring at the same time.</p>
	<p>The acting in Spotlight is also superb, with Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams deserving the most praise.  Ruffalo plays reporter Michael Rezendes, whose dedication to finding the truth and emotional mission to help the victims makes him stand out, along with McAdams character, who provides a female touch.  The way the reporters handled talking to the victims was particularly touching.</p>
	<p>The one thing that I didn’t care for about The Big Short was its transition from ‘Oh my god, we’re going to get rich off of this!’ to ‘Oh my god, the market has completely crashed, woe is me.’  It kind of seemed too abrupt to me after building the movie up as a ‘heist’ movie.  Overall, the scenes depicting the change were well done but it left me kind of depressed after the movie ended.  The two young characters looked like schmucks with their lack of appreciation for this, until Brad Pitt’s character criticizes them for it.  Done well, but it made some of the characters kind of unlikeable for being greedy.  Spotlight, on the other hand, featured moral characters that weren’t driven by greed, but by the truth.  Michael Keaton’s character, the editor of the Spotlight team, stands out for past digressions (which I won’t reveal for those not wanting spoilers).</p>

	<p>On the flipside, Spotlight’s plot didn’t particularly stand out.  I’ve seen other newspaper conspiracy type films with better and more interesting; Zodiac, the 2007 film about the Zodiac Killer had a far more interesting plot of the newspaper conspiracy trying to figure out who the Zodiac Killer was.  That to me was a far better and more fascinating film than the uncovering of the Catholic church protecting its pedophile priests.</p>
	<p>Despite neither movie being perfect and having its flaws, I found The Big Short to be more interesting and better of the two films.  Working in the mortgage servicing industry, I learned a thing or two about mortgage loans and the housing market in general.  It was a more original approach to give it the light-hearted touch rather than Spotlight, the more conventional film.  Spotlight is still better than the previous Best Picture, Birdman, a movie I found to be odd, but not as good as some of the past Best Picture winners; Slumdog Millionaire (2008), No Country for Old Men (2007), The Departed (2006) and Million Dollar Baby (2004) are four films from this millennium that won Best Picture that I loved.  Great emotional acting is always great to have, but at the end of the day, I’m driven by plot and originality more.</p>
