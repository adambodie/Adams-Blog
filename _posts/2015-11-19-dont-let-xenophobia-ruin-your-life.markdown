intro: "There are plenty of people who are afraid of people who aren't like them, and it makes me sick to read.  Diversity is one of the greatest things about the United States.  We have lots of ethnicities, religions, identities, etc.  I, for one, am proud to be an American that accepts all races, religions, etc.  We need to embrace others, not fear those who are not like us."

	<h4>Peace: Not Hate</h4>

<p>When I was a young student at West TV, we had a speaker from the United Arab Emirates give a speech.  I don't recall what the speech was about, but what I do remember was that this man wrote my name out in Arabic.  I thought it was the coolest thing.  Obviously a young kid is impressionable, but I didn't see anything wrong with the fact that the man spoke Arabic.  I wish I had kept that slip of paper.  But I kept an open mind, and am better for it.</p>
<p>On the flip side, we have politicians like Chris Christie suggesting that we shouldn't even let five year olds from Syria into our country as refugees.  It's outrageous to even suggest that a child that young could be a 'potential terrorist.'  People who would stoop to that level are consumed that we should fear the unknown, that somehow, any refugee could be a terrorist, even children.  In that respect, it's much better to view the positive side of things than dwell on negative aspects, and you'll have a much happier life in doing so.</p>
<p>Naturally, we all have differences that we may take offense to.  No matter who you are, you'll meet someone that has a different view you don't approve.  I met someone in middle school who admitted she had problems accepting Jewish people due to her Muslim faith.  I also met a black woman who admitted not being comfortable around white people.  While I don't necessarily agree with these views, it's not a reason to be prejudiced back at them.  Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and it doesn't give one a reason to lump them by race or religion.  I don't take offense against Muslims because some of them aren't Anti-Semitic.  Nor do I hold any hard feelings against people uncomfortable with other races.   As a young person, I did not like to talk about my Jewish faith because I felt like a minority.  I once refused to get a picture with A.C. Green at a camp of his I went to because of he was really Christian and I felt I would be excluded if they knew I was Jewish.  It's not easy being a minority, but it's also not possible to lump people into specific categories based on the actions of the few who set a bad example.</p>
<p>It's much better to view the world of people as complex and individualistic than in black and white, as many xenophobes do.  Hearing politicians like Ted Cruz argue that we should only allow Christian refugees from Syria into our country implies that Muslims are all terrorists.  They are not.  In fact, ISIS, an organization of Sunni Muslims, has attacked and killed many other Muslims; Shiite, Kurds, you name it.  So obviously a black and white world view doesn't work, because if it was purely religious, Muslims wouldn't be the targets of ISIS.  Furthermore, Ted Cruz believes that being Muslim is somehow the cornerstone of all terrorism, and keeping all of them out is the only way safe.  Again, xenophobes view the world in black and white, yet many terrorist groups in the world are not Muslim at all.  Depending on your definition of terrorism, anyone can be a potential terrorist.  People like Timothy McVeigh and Theodore Kaczynski (a.k.a. the Unabomber) are terrorists for what they did.  Would Ted Cruz call these white people terrorists?  Not likely.  Ted Cruz sees Christians as good, and Muslims as bad.  It doesn't get any plainer than that.  Making such generalizations also makes you more fearful, targeting someone when another person not fitting your profile of a bad guy could be far more dangerous than you realize.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that anyone is capable of causing harm against you.  It's also true that anyone can be your friend if you get along with them well enough.  You can spend your life open to other cultures, religions and people.  By doing so, you will have a better understanding of how others think, live your life without hysteria and fear of a particular group and generally have less to worry about.  Or, if you are unwilling to get past your xenophobia, you will live your life angry and disgusted, striving for unrealistic goals of so-called purity, targeting groups for no reason other than your perceived negative stereotypes, and misplacing your trust in those who wish to cause you harm but have more in common with you than your perceived enemies.  We can never tell for sure who our friends are, and we definitely can't be sure who our enemies are.  So please, stop living your life in fear and judge them solely by their personality.  That's what determines a person's true value.</p></div>
