intro: "Today marked the announcement of all the colorful, albeit way too many, bowl games, most notably the College Football Playoff and New Year's Six games.  The Oregon Ducks weren't eligible, but the Gophers were, so I'll only have one game I need to watch.  Here are my thoughts on the more exciting bowls and playoffs."

    <p>As expected, Washington was rewarded with its first appearance in the Playoff, facing the Number 1 team in the country, Alabama in the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl.  That should be an entertaining matchup.  Washington has done a great done offensively and defensively this season, but Alabama is the best team in the country.  My first reaction is that Alabama will win by two touchdowns.  The other playoff matchup is between Clemson and Ohio State in the Playstation Fiesta Bowl.  Both teams have played strong schedules, but have at times played inconsistently, making one wonder what they would be like if they played to their full potential.  I expect this to be a close game in Clemson's favor.</p>

    <p>With the Big Ten being such a strong conference this year, the Minnesota Golden Gophers were bumped up to the Holiday Bowl, where they'll face Mike Leach and the Washington State Cougars.  This matchup should instantly bring back memories of the infamous 2006 Insight Bowl against Leach's Texas Tech squad.  Minnesota blew a 31 point lead in that game, much to the embarrassment of Gopher Nation, and then coach Glen Mason was fired the next day.  That alone should provide plenty of motivation.  With that said, the Gophers offense has been rather inconsistent, particularly with Mitch Leidner, which would pose problems with Wazzu's high flying offense.  Minnesota needs to play a perfect game, but I would be surprised if they could pull that off.  This game will be tough.</p>

    <p>There are plenty of other bowl games that look entertaining.  The Capital One Orange Bowl features Michigan against Florida State.  Michigan was one kick (Iowa) and fourth down stop (Ohio State) from being unbeaten and Big Ten champs, but will have to settle against Florida State.  The Buffalo Wild Wings Citrus Bowl features LSU against Louisville in two contrasting styles of play.  Louisville stumbled down the stretch, and although Lamar Jackson still looks like the Heisman winner, playing against LSU's hard nosed defense will be entertaining.  The Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic, another big bowl game, features Wisconsin against Western Michigan (the winner of the Group of 5 bid).  Western Michigan is 2-0 against the Big Ten (against Northwestern and Illinois), but Wisconsin is a far tougher matchup than the two Illinois schools.  Can Western Michigan win the biggest game they've ever played?  Will PJ Fleck still be the coach or will he accept another job by January 2?  The Rose Bowl features two teams playing some of the best football right now, Penn State against the Cheaters.  Penn State just missed the playoffs, but have been playing quite well.  Hopefully they beat the Cheaters.</p>

<p>But there are way too many bowl games, which dilutes the quality games.  Some of them have dumb names.  Here are a list of Bowl games which I think are meaningless and stupid.  I'm not sure what Camellia is but there's the Raycom Media Camellia Bowl, which pits Appalachian State against Toledo.  I'm not sure why Boca Raton needs its own bowl game, but Memphis plays against Western Kentucky in the Boca Raton Bowl.  There's always the Famous Idaho Potato Bowl, which has Idaho (go figure) against Colorado State.  Same thought for St. Petersburg as for Boca Raton, which has Miami (Ohio) vs. Mississippi State.  Zaxby's Heart of Dallas Bowl needs a better sponsor.  Army plays North Texas in that game.  Now Motel 6 is in the sponsorship, as the host the Motel 6 Cactus Bowl, pitting Boise State and Baylor.  And I'm puzzled as to what the Belk Bowl is or what it's about.  Arkansas plays Virginia Tech in that one.</p>
