intro: "When it comes to the NBA, there are two types of players who dominate; players with amazing skills and smarts, and players with an unmatched physical advantage, players I like to call ‘a physical freak of nature.’ While players like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant will come and go, the physical freaks are rarer, and though not all players in the category are elite, the ones who do are able to use their advantageous attributes effectively and skillfully. Today, it comes as no surprise that Shaquille O’Neal, a man who needs no introduction, was selected to join the Basketball Hall of Fame. There was never a player like Shaq when he was playing, and with the changing of the style of play in professional basketball, there will probably never be a player as dominant and larger-than-life as Shaq, both physically and verbally."

<p>When Shaq first entered the NBA with the Orlando Magic, he made an immediate impact, scoring at will against his opponents, blocking whatever shots came his way, and rebounding at will.  He also made his presence with his colorful personality and propensity for entertainment,  whether it was his rapping career or his acting, Shaq was immediately one to stand out.  I certainly had my share of Shaq memorabilia when I was young; toys, posters, video games, etc.  I even saw him star in the crappy Kazaam movie, where Shaq played a genie.  But as a player, Shaq had yet to reach his prime, and when he did, it was scary.</p>

<p>With the 90’s dominated by MJ (and Hakeem Olajuwon when MJ was briefly retired), Shaq’s Magic could only taste the NBA Finals once, losing the Hakeem and the Rockets easily.  Perhaps the only center that could play effectively against Shaq at the time, but with a different skill set, Shaq’s turn was coming.  But it wasn't in Orlando, a place Shaq referred to as a pond.  With that, he headed West to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he reached his prime.</p>

<p>Though his first couple of years with the Lakers didn’t reap any immediate super success, it wasn’t until the Lakers hired Phil Jackson as coach that the Lakers became the Champs.  Along with the rise of talented youngster Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were soon the team to beat as Shaq reached the prime of his career, and watching him play, there was nothing anyone could do to slow him down.  His size, strength and footwork made Shaq unstoppable, with no one even close to slowing him down, and having Phil Jackson as coach, Shaq was disciplined and motivated to win, win, win, as the Lakers won three in a row from 2000-2002.  Sure, people could Hack-A-Shaq him and make him shoot free throws, his only weakness, but seriously, how many teams were successfully able to comeback and win from Hack-A-Shaq?  While Kobe was and is my favorite player, anyone with half a brain could tell you that Shaq was the first option and best reason for the Lakers dominance.  His MVP winning 2000 season was perhaps the most dominating year anyone has ever had in the NBA, one vote shy of an unanimous MVP vote, and it’s hard to believe Allen Iverson got one vote.</p>

<p>As a Kobe fan, I lost some respect for Shaq after the two started feuding, leading to Shaq being traded to Miami.  It was sad to see such a great duo break up, but it’s also not surprising as the two were both A-Stars, unwilling to be B-Stars.  The feud between the two was rather stupid, mostly coming from Shaq’s end, with the constant name calling and references to ‘he who shall not be named.’  But looking back, it probably was kind of foolish to be too harsh against Shaq, as he’s always been the goofy funny guy who doesn’t take too much seriously.  All his nicknames, comments and outside forms of entertainment, it seemed like a plea for attention, and it was true, Shaq did it for the attention.  There was obviously something boiling deep down, but not as extreme as it seemed.  Kobe made his comments, but they were much more calculated.  It was great to see that feud end and now they are on friendlier terms (perhaps it’s a good thing they both dislike Dwight Howard…).</p>

<p>True to the word, Shaq is one of a kind, a player whose size, strength and personality make him out of the world, a unique player whose skill set may never be matched.  With the NBA becoming a guard's game, no one has even come close as a center to matching Shaq, and it may not ever get there.  The NBA All-Star doesn't have a vote for strictly centers, because of the lack of talented centers.  Big men are rarely if ever seen as a high priority in the draft.  Even the Lakers, home of some of the best Centers ever to play in the NBA (Shaq included), took point guard D’Angelo Russell last year with the second pick in the draft to be the future of their franchise, passing up big men Jahlil Okafor and Kristaps Porzingis.  So while we now play in a guard’s game, where the best player today weighs about half of Shaq’s size (Steph Curry), it's unfortunate that the NBA may never see a player like Shaq again, both in stature and character.</p>

<p>As a personality, Shaq always had a clever nickname or phrase to say, mostly about himself (‘The Great Aristotle’, ‘Shaq-Fu’, ‘Superman’, etc.) and his playful taunts of his opponents (who could forget the Sacramento Queens).  He had a larger than life personality, a great smile and charisma to make even the most sad person smile.  Shaq was and is one of a kind, a welcomed addition to the Hall of Fame and an all-time legend.  The Hall of Fame will never be the same again.</p>
