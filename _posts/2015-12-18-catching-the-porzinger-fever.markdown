intro: "On the night of the 2015 NBA Draft, many people turned in to see which young prospects their team would select. Though the NBA Draft was held in Barclays Center (home of the Brooklyn Nets), it's fans of the New York Knicks (who play in the Madison Square Garden, the traditional home of the draft) that are the loudest and most obnoxious. Many of their fans don't know a whole lot about all the prospects, mostly knowing those they see on TV, i.e. those who play for big time college basketball teams, which is why, when the New York Knicks selected a young Latvian kid named Kristaps Porzingis, they loudly booed the selection."

<p>Who could blame them?  For every Dirk Nowitzki that becomes a star, there's a Darko Milicic waiting in the wings to be subpar.  European players get more flack because they are largely unknown before coming over, but then again, for every LeBron James, there's Kwame Brown.  The whole NBA Draft is a crapshoot, you never know what you're going to get.  So was it justified for Knicks fan to boo 'the Latvian kid?'</p>

<p>Fast forward to December 2015, where after six weeks into the NBA Season, it has become fairly clear that Kristaps Porzingis was worth the high pick.  While he's not the next LeBron James, averaging 13 points, 8 rebounds and 2 blocks a game at the time of this article, the Knicks have been far better than they were last year, with the help of his defensive prowess, dunking abilities and the ability to stretch the floor.  So why all the fuss?</p>

<p>He's only 20 years old, with plenty of time to improve his game, but standing at 7'3‚Äù and being more than a low post player, Kristaps Porzingis is immediately compared to Dirk Nowitzki, whose size and shooting skills (along with his heart) have made him one of the best NBA players of his generation and one of the best from Europe.  But Nowitzki does not have as strong of a post game as Porzingis shown.  Many people may forget how poorly Nowitzki played as a rookie, being called a bust, but by year two, Nowitzki starting showing off his skills and has since become the heralded great he is today.  Porzingis, by comparison, has looked fairly comfortable from the get go.</p>

<p>What really makes Porzingis special is his unique combination of size, agility, shooting and strength.  Most big men his size cannot shoot from a distance.  They definitely are not able to keep up with the smaller players or play for long periods of time.  Whether Porzingis is able to sustain long-term success remains a big question, but if the Knicks manage him properly, he has the potential to be something special.  Much like LeBron James or Shaquille O'Neal, Porzingis is a physical specimen, a 'freak of nature' as they call it.  It's difficult to defend a player his size that can shoot three-pointers with some consistency; 33% is much higher than 0% most 7-footers make.  Sometimes, having those unique and difficult to stop physical features is all some players need, even though most don't have them.</p>

<p>So the big question remains, why has Porzinger Fever caught on so quickly.  For one thing, he plays in the biggest market in the NBA.  Everyone gets attention in New York.  After all, how can anyone forget the two weeks Linsanity brought upon for the Knicks back in 2012.  Now that Jeremy Lin plays for the Charlotte Hornets, does anyone even care anymore?  Not really.  But combined with the fact that the Knicks have played much better than last year (which was awful by all standards) shows that the Knicks have someone who's a winner.  Thirteen wins through mid-December is far far better than seventeen wins in an entire year.  He's already racked up three endorsement deals (something that probably wouldn't happen in, for example, Charlotte) and people always love an underdog, even those who booed him on draft night.  He even gets bonus points for kind of looking like the young version of infamous Rocky IV fighter Ivan Drago.  So while it seems that the Knicks fans, and fans all over the world will root for just about anything that brings attention to their club, only time will remain whether Porzinger Fever is here to stay or just another case of Linsanity.</p>
