intro: "When I watched Netflix's <a href='http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/entertainment/2016/01/19/making-a-murderer-my-thoughts-on-the-steven-avery-case'>Making a Murderer</a> early in January, the biggest puzzling thing about that case was that Steven Avery's nephew Brendan Dassey was convicted of anything at all, much less for the murder of Teresa Halbach based on a clearly coerced confession.  As news hit yesterday that a Federal judge in Milwaukee agreed, overturning the conviction, I can't help but feel relieved that Dassey got some redemption."

    <p>Clearly, Brendan Dassey had nothing to do with the murder.  Watching the confession tape, it's clear that Dassey was manipulated by the cops.  Thankfully, the Federal judge in Milwaukee rightfully pointed out that the police who interviewed him made up false promises and Dassey, with a low IQ, seemed eager to tell the cops what they wanted so he could go back home, as the police promised him.  Of course, they lied their asses off, and Dassey was arrested after the false confession.  With all the talk about police corruption around the country, it's not a surprise they would do this.  Even worse, Dassey, just 16 at the time, did not have his mother as was required, as he needed her help with his low IQ.  And of course, his initial defense attorney was not present and seemed too eager to make a deal with the prosecutors in exchange for grilling Steven Avery.  The Federal judge deemed he was excited by the media coverage and did nothing to help his client.  Had police followed protocol, Dassey's mother would have set them straight, but instead, they bullied him and arrested him while he was too mentally disabled to understand what was going on.  The prosecution has 90 days to bring him back to trial, but since his false confession was the only thing that got him convicted, it's unlikely they would do so.</p>
    <p>The bigger question remains, how does affect Steven Avery?  It was my opinion that there wasn't enough evidence to convict him.  Most of the evidence was coincidential at best; the blood in the RAV4, the key found at the dresser, and so on.  Not to mention a lack of motive.  His lawyers fought hard and presented an arguable case in my opinion.  But while some have argued that the Manitowoc County police framed him and planted evidence, I still find this kind of ridiculous.  I do believe they were too eager to investigate Steven Avery since he was the last person to be seen with Teresa Halbach.  Just like the initial rape case he wrongfully spent in prison.  They clearly had a bone to pick with Avery and were so focused on him, they ignored the evidence that pointed to the real rapist.  It's possible they planted evidence, but I don't think they killed her.  Someone with a grudge against Avery could've very well killed Halbach.  After all, they never found the body.</p>
    <p>As for Brendan Dassey, the system was rigged against him, as it is for many people falsely accussed and convicted of crimes.  The police were so eager to place him at the scene of the crime that they bullied him into telling them what they wanted to hear to fit their story.  It happens to too many people, targeting those who are vulnerable, mental disabilties amongst them.  How the jury convicted him of all charges; murder, rape and mutilation of a corpse, which Steven Avery wasn't even convicted of all those charges, is quite puzzling.  Different jury aside and different lawyers (not as good as Avery's), the jurors took his false words at face value and didn't consider anything else.  That the was only evidence they had against him, basically.  Now that the conviction has been overthrown, they have nothing against him.  It goes to show how corrupt our legal system and police officers can get.  I've read plenty of stories, more so recently, about mass police corruption in Baltimore, Cleveland and Ferguson, painting a grim picture of officers taking advantage of minorities, and it can certainly happen to anyone the police wants to target.  While it's easy for some to claim "The police is always right," while claiming "It's wrong to accuse police of acting stupidly," clearly anyone can be corrupt, including those who serve.  At the end of the day, Brendan Dassey got his redemption and hopefully those police officers would get punished for not following protocol.  There are too many good police officers getting lumped with the bad ones.</p>
    <p>It's good to know that Brendan Dassey got his conviction overturned.  If I were him, I would file a lawsuit against the Manitowoc County police, like Steven Avery did years earlier.  It would also be good for Dassey to move as far away from the county as he reasonably could.  Probably not realistic, but he deserves better, just like Steven Avery.  Now we'll wait to see what happens to him.  Can they prove his innocence?  Will they get better results on the blood in the RAV4?  What about the biased juror?  There are way too many questions left unanswered about Steven Avery's case.  In the meantime, we can rejoice that Brendan Dassey got his redemption for something he clearly had no involvement in.</p>
