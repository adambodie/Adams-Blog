Learning new ways to make blog posts or any developing tools in general is something I have always enjoyed.  With that said, I am revamping my blog post as its own entity, rather than part of the Express framework I'm using for Bodie Web Design.

What are the advantages of doing this, you ask?  Let me explain the ways to you in the most simplistic ways.  This new blog engine is powered by Jekyll, a static website generator powered by Ruby.  With it, I have more flexibility as to how I can layout my blog.  Gone are the days of sticking to one layout as I have been doing with my Jade-JSON backed blog posts.  Now I can use markdown files, which translates raw text to HTML.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
