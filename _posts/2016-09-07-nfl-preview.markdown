intro: "As further proof of the seasons changing, the NFL season is about to start, with a Thursday night rematch of Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos vs. the Carolina Panthers.  It should be an exciting year in the NFL, with a lot of notable events in the offseason and plenty of more on the way.  Which team will surprise this year?  Which team will disappoint this year?  Who wins the MVP?  Here's my thoughts on the NFL season on the horizon."

    <p>I was really looking forward to this season, the Minnesota Vikings were primed to make an explosion with their new stadium, US Bank Stadium up and running.  Teddy Bridgewater looked great and ready to take the next step.  Unfortunately, he tore his ACL and dislocated his knee in practice, ending his year before it started.  That left the Vikings in shock and disbelief, but with the perfect coach in Mike Zimmer, who should have been hired as a coach years ago but the Vikings aren't going to complain about that one, still have the talent to at least make the playoffs, led by Adrian Peterson (still as strong as ever) and an elite defense.  Clearly, the Vikings are going for a moon shot this year, which is why they acquired Sam Bradford from Philadelphia to replace Teddy Bridgewater this year.  A HUGE gamble to say the least, as Sam Bradford is talented, but has little time to learn the offense.  For his sake, he's in a better place than his previous stops, but only time will tell if the gamble pays off or not.  As for the rest of the NFC North, the Detroit Lions will be a different team with Calvin Johnson retiring, as we will once and for all see if Matthew Stafford is a capable quarterback or just the product of Calvin Johnson's freakish skills.  Chicago will remain mediocre, there's no reason to believe Jay Cutler will be any better or worse than before.  The Green Bay Packers, as long as they have Aaron Rodgers at Quarterback, will remain Super Bowl contenders.  My pick to win the NFC North: Green Bay.</p>
    
    <p>Their first opponent of the season is another team I've got my eye on, the Tennessee Titans, led by Marcus Mariota.  Mariota started his career with a perfect passer rating, but the Titans lacked the right weapons or coaching staff, as the Titans finished with a league worst 2-14 record.  Mike Mularkey is now the Head Coach, an interim for the failed Ken Whisenhunt.  Tennessee now has some better offensive weapons, with DeMarco Murray and last year's Heisman winner Derrick Henry joining the team as a dynamic Running Back duo.  There's no question Mariota has the talent and drive to succeed, but with Tennessee still young, how much will they improve?  Just remember, Peyton Manning had a 3-13 record in his rookie year.  Of course, the AFC South is up for grabs.  Indianapolis gave Andrew Luck a big extension, yet there are plenty of questions of surrounding players.  Houston still has a great defense led by J.J. Watt, a talented wide receiver in DeAndre Hopkins, but questions still remain at the Quarterback position, although Brock Osweiler appears to be an upgrade from the Brian Hoyer/Ryan Mallett combo from last year.  Jacksonville hasn't done much to improve their roster, and the jury's still out on Blake Bortles.  My pick to win the AFC South: Indianapolis.</p>

    <p>The New England Patriots are as loaded as ever, but Tom Brady finally got his suspension from Deflate-gate completed, so Brady will have to miss the first four games of this season.  Can Jimmy Garoppolo succeed while Brady's on mandatory vacation?  As long as Rob Gronkowski's around, I imagine the Patriots will be just fine.  The rest of the division is mediocre.  The New York Jets have a nice defense, but Ryan Fitzpatrick held out most of training camp and although he played well last year, I can't completely get behind him.  Buffalo has loudmouth schnook Rex Ryan as coach, which has improved their defense, but Tyrod Taylor is still an unknown as a Quarterback.  Miami is a confusing team, and Ryan Tannehill is the most unpredictable quarterback in the NFL, why Miami gave him a big contract is beyond me.  My pick to win the AFC East: New England.</p>
    
    <p>Chip Kelly, fired from the Philadelphia Eagles, takes his talents west to the San Francisco 49ers, who have been in the news a lot recently for Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the National Anthem.  Though Kaepernick is now the teams backup quarterback, behind Blaine Gabbert (of all people), Chip will get another shot of perfecting his style of play in the NFL.  Kaepernick seemed like a good fit, but hasn't been playing as well (or has been all that healthy) to be the starter.  Thankfully, Chip Kelly won't be GM for the 49ers, because that's what cost him his job with the Eagles.  Too many questions about the 49ers roster and playing in a tough division won't help.  The NFL returns to Los Angeles as the Rams left St. Louis to come back to LA.  They still have questions about their Quarterback as top pick Jared Goff hasn't looked that well so far and was named third string at the moment behind Case Keenum and Sean Mannion (who would've thought that).  Same division as the 49ers, but lots of pressure on coach Jeff Fisher, who's obviously talented but hasn't gotten the Rams where they need to be.  Hopefully, they will get the continued production from running back Todd Gurley, who looks like a future star.  Seattle is still as talented as ever, with their stout defense, but they have lost key players since their Super Bowl win a few years ago, and Marshawn Lynch retired.  The Arizona Cardinals are still talented, and Bruce Arians is one of the best coaches in the NFL.  But who knows whether Carson Palmer can continue being the great quarterback he is.  My pick to win the NFC West: Seattle.</p>

    <p>No team will be more puzzling to figure out than the Super Bowl Champions, the Denver Broncos.  On the on hand, their defense as a great as ever, led by Von Miller at Linebacker, whose suffocating play carried them to the Super Bowl victory over the high powered Carolina Panthers.  On the other hand, Peyton Manning retired and their quarterback replacement wound up in an unexpected way.  Brock Osweiler left for Houston, Mark Sanchez was acquired but didn't do much (ultimately, he was cut), Paxton Lynch was drafted as the future QB, but it was third string Quarterback Trevor Siemian who was named the starter after an impressive preseason.  Siemian played just one snap his rookie season, a kneel down at the end of a game, now in his second season, becomes the first Quarterback to start for a Super Bowl Champion without a single pass attempt in the NFL.  Should be very interesting to see how well they perform.  Kansas City has plenty of talent, and Alex Smith has slowly become one of the most reliable quarterbacks in the NFL.  The 49ers should have kept him over Kaepernick, but who could blame them at the time.  The Raiders, perhaps in their last year in Oakland, have suddenly shown some signs of respectability, with Derek Carr having great potential as a star Quarterback.  Their defense has improved, led by Khalil Mack, who's a complete stud.  The big question is whether the Raiders can play consistently in what might be their last year in Oakland.  One thing's for sure, the NFL would never be the same if they do in fact move to Las Vegas.  San Diego looks like a complete mess, totally wasting Philip Rivers potential as their Quarterback.  Never a good sign when rookie Joey Bosa just signed a deal after a long and pointless holdout.  My pick to win the AFC West: Kansas City.</p>
    
    <p>The AFC North, like always, will run through Pittsburgh, despite the suspension from running back LeVeon Bell.  Their defense is still good, and Ben Roethlisberger is still elite.  Baltimore had a down year last season, but with Joe Flacco still around, Baltimore will have a better year this season, but still looks mediocre at best.  Cincinnati looked like it was about to take the next step last year, and Andy Dalton certainly took the next step, but their defense is still completely undisciplined.  Plus with Hue Jackson now head coach of the Cleveland Browns, their offense could take a dive.  One thing remains for sure, the Cleveland Browns are still a terrible team.  Robert Griffin III, a.k.a. RGIII is desperate to revive his career, and he definitely needed to leave Washington, but Cleveland is still quarterback purgatory.  My feeling is that RGIII is damaged goods, and it's unfortunate, because I was pretty high on him entering the NFL.  My pick to win the AFC North: Pittsburgh.</p>

 		<h4>No defensive player will be more crucial this year than Von Miller</h4>

    <p>Carolina remains the best team in the NFC South, but the potential for a post-Super Bowl hangover could derail their hopes.  But with Cam Newton still extremely talented and most of their core back, they're still dangerous.  The Atlanta Falcons have Matt Ryan leading the way, and Julio Jones is still a talented Wide Receiver, but I'm not sure they'll be anything more than .500 team.  Tampa Bay has potential to improve this year, with Jameis Winston showing some potential, but they fired Lovie Smith as head coach and replaced him with Dirk Koetter, a puzzling move to say the least.  Meanwhile, the New Orleans Saints still have defensive flaws and will need to lean on Drew Brees once again to provide their offense.  My pick to win the NFC South: Carolina</p>
    
    <p>The NFC East will still be up for grabs this year.  Washington was the best team last year, but they benefited from a weak division.  They were exposed in the playoffs.  I still have my doubts on Kirk Cousins.  Dallas will remain in limbo as long as quarterback Tony Romo remains hurt.  Who knows when he will come back.  Of course, Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott could very well be the new dynamic duo.  They still need Romo's leadership.  The New York Giants have a new coach, with Tom Coughlin retiring, and as long as Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. remain on the roster, the Giants can win some games, especially in a weak division.  Philadelphia looks like a complete mess, it's as if they completely wiped out the core of Chip Kelly's roster moves last year.  Now that Sam Bradford was traded, it's up to rookie Carson Wentz to lead what's left over for that offense.  My pick to win the NFC East: The New York Giants.</p>

 		<h4>The Vikings new stadium: US Bank Stadium.  All I can say is Wow!</h4>
 </div>       
    <p>The AFC has plenty of strong teams like last year, and it will remain tough this year.  New England, Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Indianapolis will make the playoffs winning their divisions, with Denver and the New York Jets getting in as wild cards.  The NFC will also have some strong teams, but won't be as strong as the AFC.  Seattle, Green Bay, Carolina and New York Giants will make the playoffs winning their divisions, with Minnesota and Arizona making the wild cards.  My prediction for the Super Bowl is New England vs. Green Bay, with the Patriots winning it all.  As usual, they're the most complete team, even with Brady out four games, it won't affect their Super Bowl or playoff dreams.</p>
