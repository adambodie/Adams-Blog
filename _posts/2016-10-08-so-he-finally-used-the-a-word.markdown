intro: "It took sixteen months, but the Idiot finally used the A-word he never likes to use: <strong>APOLOGIZE</strong>.  What did it take for him to apologize?  A video mic drop recording of him saying some incredibly vulgar things about women, essentially bragging about hitting on a married woman and getting away with groping women because he’s a star.  He called it 'locker room banter,' I call it 'words a sexual predator would say.'  Now that he's used the A-word, he can now apologize to everyone he’s offended in his life.  Here's an partial list of everyone owed an apology.  He's offended so many people it's hard to keep track."
