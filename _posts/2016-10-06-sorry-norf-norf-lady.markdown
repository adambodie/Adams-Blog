intro: "Recently, I read about a viral video of a Christian woman, a mother of four, who blogged her video reaction upon listening to a rap song she heard on the radio, rapping the song line by line and getting upset over the lyrics.  The song in question, Norf Norf, by Vince Staples, is a typical example of a gangsta rap song.  Not surprisingly, the woman was quite offended that this song would appear on the radio, proclaiming the songs of the old days are better for kids.  Not surprisingly, that is simply not true, and there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface."

    <p>There are plenty of songs on the radio that have inappropriate lyrics.  Some people may be surprised that plenty songs from way back then are about either slightly to very inappropriate things.  Every Breath you Take, by The Police?  A song about a guy stalking a woman who leaves him breathless.  Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix?  Like plenty of rock songs from that time, about drugs.  And who could forget all the pop songs from the old days singing about sex (Britney Spears, Christian Aguilera, anybody)?  But of course, it's only a problem for some when a rapper makes music about life in the streets.  There have been plenty of gangsta raps songs on the radio since the days of N.W.A. proclaiming "Fuck Tha Police."  Vince Staples is certainly no different than any gangsta rapper from Long Beach or anywhere in the world.  To assume that music was more clean back in the days is wrong.  Nothing has really changed for rappers in the ghetto.</p>
    <p>It's hard for many to understand living the street life because they don't live it.  It is disturbing for those who see it from the outside, myself included.  But what people don't ever think about is that most people who live in the streets don't actually want that life.  No one ever stops to think about the people of the ghetto themselves, rather they see them merely as a stereotype.  For people like Vince Staples, and countless of other people growing up in the ghetto, this is the only life they know, their normal.  They don't know anything else.  So when Vince Staples raps about 'running from the police,' that's because it's what he's used to.  It's not glamorizing like people assume, but their reality.  In fact, for some with skills like Vince Staples, it's a way out of that life.</p>
    <p>While it's true that children shouldn't listen to inappropriate lyrics, it's also true that plenty of people don't pay attention to the lyrics of the songs.  Often times, rappers rap so fast that people don't bother to listen or understand the lyrics.  For those, it's all about the beat.  So for those who do listen to the lyrics, they shouldn't be that surprised.  Try listening to rappers like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Twista and tell me you can recite their lyrics off the dome.  And with songs like Panda by Desiigner on the radio constantly, who cares about the lyrics?  Does anyone know what the heck he's talking about?</p>

    <p>When it's all said and done, this woman shouldn't let her children listen to songs like this, but while she's entitled to her own opinion, she shouldn't slander rappers like Vince Staples over the content of their songs.  Their music isn't meant for kids, anyway, so like life in general, it's up to the parents to do their best to keep their kids from listening to this music, not complain about the rappers themselves or demanding such music not be played on the radio.  In this day and age, anyone can pull up Norf Norf or any other rap song on iTunes, youTube or any other website that features music.  It's up to the parents to set the good example.  There are plenty of people whose demographic is more suitable for songs like Norf Norf that enjoy the music, like myself.  But if I don't like a song or get offended by it (which isn't likely), I simply choose to ignore it because I can't decide for someone else whether they should listen to songs or not.</p>
    <p>When asked about it, Vince Staples defended the woman's right to have an opinion, stating that she can make up her own mind, but at the same time, pointing out that she doesn't understand what the song is all about, leading her to be frightened.  And that, in its essence, is what leads so many people to 'freak out.'  They have no idea what it's like to live in the ghetto.  Just as someone in the ghetto has no idea what it's like to be a devout Christian obsessed with all things Jesus.  There's no point for this woman nor anyone else outside to try to comprehend that life, but to me, understanding the struggle itself is what's most important when listening to music in general.  I'll never understand life in the ghetto, but I can certainly listen to a dope rapper and feel his/her struggle and emotion.  That's what makes rappers like Kendrick Lamar so great.  In the meantime, I'll play Norf Norf and try to figure out what the title Norf Norf means.</p>
