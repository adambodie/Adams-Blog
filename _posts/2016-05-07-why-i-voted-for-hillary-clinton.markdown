intro: "At the end of this year, the United States is going to elect a new President, as Obama’s two terms reaches its end.  With that said, it’s important to me that we continue to make progress in building our country's economy, security and social progression.  The Republican’s presumptive candidate is Donald Trump, billionaire entrepreneur and reality TV star.  I will never vote for Donald Trump; he attracts the worst kind of attention and has led the most hateful campaign ever.  But it was much more difficult to choose between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, her Democrat competition for the Democratic nominee.  Though both candidates have their strengths and weaknesses, in the end I am throwing my support behind Mrs. Hillary Clinton."

	<p>Neither Hillary nor Bernie excite me as a candidate in the same way Barack Obama did back in 2008.  When Hillary Clinton announced her candidacy, most people assumed she was easily win, but Bernie surprised many by mounting an amazing grassroots style campaign that would make Obama envious.  I salute Bernie Sanders for bringing up many of the issues I consider the biggest detriments to a successful country; corruption of the Elite class, Citizens United allowing unlimited cash flow to candidates, and a power structure that favors money over the people.  Our problems are bigger than the issues themselves, with the structure of Congress and its ridiculous rules preventing any progress from happening.</p>

	<p>But when it comes to ideas, Bernie Sanders’ ideas sound too good to be true and unrealistic, and to me, ideas are important.  As Comedian Dave Chappelle once said on his hit sketch show Chappelle’s Show, “Complex problems require complex solutions.”  And it’s true, it’s not as simple as ‘Free education for all’ or ‘Medicare for all’ as Bernie Sanders has suggested as solutions to raising the middle class.  While these things sound nice, they’re unattainable and unrealistic.  It’s for this reason that I didn’t vote for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic Primary.</p>

<p>On the flip side, Hillary Clinton isn’t perfect as a candidate, and there are characteristics I certainly don’t like about her, but yet many of the issues the Republicans keep talking about are mere distractions and unimportant to the Presidential race.  The obvious issue the Republicans keep trying to convince us is the worst attack in our lifetime (nevermind 9/11) is the Benghazi attack.  Though it was tragic to see four men die in the attack, including our Ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, to hear Republicans say it, Hillary all but invited the terrorists involved to make the attack, and even though they have held numerous wasteful hearings trying to find out ‘the truth’, they’ve accomplished nothing but proven what a political witch-hunt this has become.  As House Majority leader Kevin McCarthy infamous stated, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s untrustable. But no one would have known any of that had happened, had we not fought.”  Clearly, the issue is political partisanship at its worst, and yet, Hillary Clinton has held her own against United States House Select Committee on Benghazi chairman Trey Gowdy, never buckling down from hours of pointless and repetitive questions.  Republicans know she’s strong and know she’s a threat to taking over the Presidency chair.</p>

<p>The second issue which Republicans keep talking about is the e-mail issue.  Hillary Clinton may have used a private server for using her personal e-mail address for official government uses, which sounds naive and irresponsible at best, but with laws on e-mails and record keeping were evolving at the time, it’s unclear whether Hillary broke any actual laws.  That’s not to say other politicians have done similar, whether it’s Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell or Jeb Bush.  Yet no one cares ever bothered to investigate them like Hillary has been by the Republicans.  Same with Benghazi.  Thousands of people died on 9/11; if Al Gore were president, the Republicans would have spent eight years investigating him.  It’s their only recourse against a woman who’s not only strong but has the balls to take them on head-on.  Republicans claim this is a major trust issue, as many who don’t like Hillary don’t trust her, but Politicians on the whole are untrustworthy.  Every politician lies, and Hillary Clinton is no less untrustworthy than her opponents or friends, so as Bernie Sanders said during the first Democrat debate, “The american people are sick and tired of hearing about her [Hillary's] damn emails.”  Please, give me a break.</p>

<p>Bill Clinton was the best president of my lifetime.  He did great wonders for the United States, and his centrist Liberal views were a plus for me.  Being married to Bill Clinton for many years, I would hope that Hillary has learned a thing or two from Bill on how to get things done.  To me, that is one of her biggest strengths; her unrelentless approach.  But unlike Bill, Hillary seems more willing to shift her views to make herself appeal to the Progressive left.  This would be fine for a Progressive, but I don’t consider myself that Liberal.  Bernie Sanders has pushed her towards his direction for better or worse.  And yes, Hillary has a goofy personality, kind of like Joe Biden but with a stronger aggressive side, which kind of turns me off.  However, with that aggressive personality is the ability to get things done, which she has accomplished throughout the years as Senator and Secretary of State.  Her experience with National Security issues is a plus, which is something the Republican candidate can’t say.</p>

<p>The best reason to vote for Hillary Clinton, is that despite all her faults with her personality and trustworthiness, she’s not Donald Trump.  Donald Trump would be a complete disaster as President of the United States.  Virtually everyone around the world can’t stand the guy; the only person who seems to like him is our supposed #1 geopolitical foe, Vladimir Putin of Russia, who like Trump is a bully incapable of listening to anybody.  Trump would make our country a joke, with other countries unwilling to work with a chauvinistic greedy xenophobic divisive putz.  We need someone who is serious about fixing our problems, rather than someone who thinks this is all a joke, like Trump has proven over and over again.  Having an unpredictable loose cannon that acts like a five year old when being criticized is a poor quality and completely unpresidential.  It’s not as easy as making mindless chants and gimmicks; being President requires intelligence and great decision making, something Donald Trump does not have.  Although Hillary Clinton is not the most mature person out there, anyone is better than a spoiled child who expects everyone to say ‘Yes’ to him.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is a poor businessman at best, lame reality TV star at best, and a horrible Presidential candidate who has completely destroyed the Republican party’s credibility.  America deserves better than this.  Truth be told, we’re screwed no matter who’s President; we still have incompetent Senators, Congressmen and Congresswomen who bicker like babies and refuse to work with each other in an attempt to win the game.  But we’ve made progress with Obama despite the Republicans obstructionist ways, despite the Recession left over from George W Bush’s Presidency.  We can’t replace Obama with an idiot who doesn’t know where Obama was born, thinks the Chinese invented global warming to improve their economy, acts like non-white foreigners are the root of all our nations problems, and most important, an idiot who has never given a damn about anyone else in his life other than himself.  Vote Hillary Clinton for President.  Thank you.</p>
