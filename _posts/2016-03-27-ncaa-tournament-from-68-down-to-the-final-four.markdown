intro: "This year’s March Madness has truly personified to term Madness, to say the least. My bracket was shot early on, as Michigan State, my pick to win it all, got shocked by Middle Tennessee State, in what was statistically one of the biggest upsets ever. High seeds including West Virginia (3), California (4) and multiple 5 seeds, Purdue and Baylor were upset as well. My upset picks didn’t pan out, except for Gonzaga over Seton Hall and VCU over Oregon State, but not nearly as impressive as Middle Tennessee State, Little Rock, Yale, Stephen F. Austin and Hawaii winning. Here are my thoughts on the Tournament as a whole."

<p>First of all, my Oregon Ducks played well and reached the Elite Eight, but fell just short of the Final Four.  Despite a poor performance against Oklahoma, the Ducks were still impressive enough to get a 1 seed.  The only Pac-12 team to reach the Sweet Sixteen (Utah was the only other team that won), Oregon didn’t get the respect they deserved as a top seed, and plenty of doubters thought Duke would beat them (here's looking at you, President Obama).  But Oregon not only beat Duke, they completely shut them down, making them look out of place and never in rhythm.  That was an impressive game as I’ve seen the Ducks play, beating the defending Champs.  All talk about the game has gone towards Mike Krzyzewski complaining about Dillon Brooks three pointer with 6 seconds left and denying it.  Did he really think the cameras wouldn’t pick up what he said? But the Ducks were completely out-hustled by Oklahoma and couldn’t stop Buddy Hield (who’s actually a Senior, where did he come from?) as he scored 37 points, making eight three pointers at ease.  Sounds like a perfect fit for the Lakers…</p>

<p>I managed to pick one Final Four team correct, the only Number 1 seed left: North Carolina, who’s played better than anyone else in the Tournament.  They should be the favorite coming in, but then again, Kansas was the overall Number 1 Seed, and they lost to Villanova in the Elite Eight.  The Tar Heels have lots of weapons and a stifling defense.  The aforementioned Villanova, who’s struggled in the Tournament the past few years, broke my rule and made it to the Final Four.  Without a true star, the Wildcats have plenty of solid players who play with their hearts, coached by George Clooney’s look-a-like, Jay Wright.  Interesting match up against Oklahoma, who beat Villanova earlier in the year, as they have Buddy Hield as a star, while Villanova lacks star talent but has great hustle.</p>

<p>The other team to reach the Final Four is with the exception of Tulsa, the team most people felt did not belong in the Tournament at all; Syracuse.  The first 10 seed to ever reach the Final Four, Syracuse proved most wrong with impressive wins against Dayton, Gonzaga and Virginia, using a big run in the second half to beat the top seed Virginia.  Surely, the people who questioned them need to shut up, never doubt Jim Boeheim and their zone defense.  While I never thought they would make it this far, I felt they belonged in the Tournament, and not totally surprised they plated better than expected.</p>

<p>So who wins it all now:  I predict Oklahoma over Villanova because Buddy Hield is the best shooter in the NCAA since Steph Curry, yet has plenty of talented players around him, as Texas A&amp;M learned in the Sweet 16.  It will be closer than their previous match up, but Oklahoma has the talent and the heart to match up against Villanova's heart.  Should be a great game either way.  The other match-up, an All-ACC affair, matches up North Carolina against Syracuse.  Virginia has always been a tad overrated in my opinion, but not North Carolina.  They’ll easily beat Syracuse.  North Carolina, in the end, will beat Oklahoma, as they are the most complete team left, with equal the firepower and Roy Williams coaching, one of the best around.</p>

<p>Finally, I part this post with some random thoughts on the Tournament.  Northern Iowa’s game-winning half court shot against Texas was stunning; best shot in the Tournament.  Seeing it live left me in awe.  Even more stunning was blowing a 12-point lead against Texas A&amp;M with 35 seconds left (Northern Iowa ended up losing in overtime).  I kept watching the Oregon-Duke game thinking 'don’t be like Northern Iowa, this game's not over, just ask Northern Iowa' at the end.  Dillon Brooks put the nail in the coffin thankfully.  Hawaii became the first team from outside the continental U.S. to win an NCAA game.  Of course, they're the only Division I team outside the continental U.S., which makes it less impressive.  Stephen F. Austin’s Thomas Walkup is an impressive player, from his haircut to his game; heartbreaking to see Notre Dame beat them at the last second.  St. Joseph’s DeAndre Bembry played well against Cincinnati and Oregon, he’s got skills and an impressive Afro (best since Josh Childress back in the day).  Plenty of people dislike Duke's Grayson Allen for being annoying, especially with the tripping, but watching Oregon-Duke, I found Marshall Plumlee to be even more annoying, just like the other Plumlee’s.  Little Rock’s win over Purdue was sweet, Josh Nagin played out of his mind.  I thought they had a chance, I was right, but didn’t pick it.  Congrats to them.  I figured Oregon's chances against Duke were good as they struggled against Yale, congrats to them.  Hopefully this is the beginning of a great run for Oregon.  Elgin Cook's a Senior, but the other key players hopefully will be back.  Chris Boucher won an extra year of eligibility, and Freshman Tyler Dorsey might go pro, but both need another year to improve their games.  Chris Boucher is the definition of Raw talent, while Tyler Dorsey wasn't that impressive against Duke or Oklahoma.  Any way you look at it, it has been a great March Madness.  See you next year.</p>
