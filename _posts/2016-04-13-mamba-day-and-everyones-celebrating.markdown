<p>It’s 7:26 PM and the video tribute just started.  Reliving all the great memories Kobe has had, from his alley-oop to Shaq in Game 7 of the 2000 Western Conference Finals to his 81 point game against Toronto in 2006.  Kobe has had plenty of great moments, after 20 years it’s hard to remember all of them.  Some forgotten I had to re-remember still look glorious to this day, game-winners against Miami, Portland and Phoenix, among others, still look amazing and surreal.</p>

<p>Now Magic Johnson’s speaking.  One Laker great speaking about another, and well spoken as usual.  It’s true, Kobe is the best celebrity LA has had in the past 20 years, and everything Kobe has accomplish, he deserves the title of Mr. Laker, truth be told.  Put it simply, he’s the best to wear the Purple and Gold.  I’ve never seen Kobe smile as much as I’ve seen now.  And for Magic Johnson’s proclamation of Kobe’s 81 point night, I was in living in Eugene at my apartment.  My Dad had come to visit that night, and we had sushi for dinner.  My Dad’s no Laker fan but he always rooted for them in the NBA Finals when they won 5 Championships (and lost 2), so I’ll take that.</p>

<p>Now the official video starts with Shaq speaking.  After everything they went through, it’s great to see Shaq and Kobe on good terms.  Derek Fisher, Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Gregg Popovich, Kevin Garnett, Carmelo Anthony, Steph Curry, LeBron James, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom, Phil Jackson, Jack Nicholson all had great things to say about Kobe.  It about brings me to tears.  It’s true what they say, you can’t really appreciate something until it’s gone.</p>

<p>And at 7:34 PM, Kobe enters the court with everyone chanting ‘Kobe, Kobe, Kobe!’  A great thing to hear, from the past, everyone chanted ‘MVP, MVP, MVP!’ even when he didn’t deserve it.  But Kobe’s the Laker’s MVP, the all-time leading scorer, owner of multiple records, both team and league records.</p>

<p>Now, at 7:40 PM, the announcer starts his usual announcement.  Unfortunately, this game will be boring and pointless, especially since Utah was just eliminated from the last playoff spot.  But first, Laker fan Flea plays the National Anthem on the guitar.  Sounds like a weird rendition of Jimi Hendrix’s National Anthem.  Obviously, Flea can’t sing (nor be an effective Nihilist, thanks Coen Brothers for The Big Lebowski), but I would have preferred someone singing.</p>

<p>At 7:43 PM, the visitors get announced, yawn!  I was really hoping Houston would miss the playoffs, dang Houston.  Now Laker teammates are talking on video, Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Metta World Peace, Jordan Clarkson and the others, along with coach Byron Scott.  It’s a shame the Lakers have been so bad the past few years, and here comes Kobe on the floor for the last time.  The biggest cheers from an otherwise unenthusiastic announcer.  And now, we can begin an otherwise forgettable game.</p>

<p>Game just started at 7:48 PM, and a minute later, Kobe missed his first shot of the game.  Meanwhile, this has been a crazy season for the NBA.  At this time, on ESPN, compared to this game on ESPN, the Golden State Warriors are seeking an NBA record 73 wins!  They are one scary team; if they can keep their core of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguadola, they can be the NBA’s next dynasty.  Watching the Lakers now, they suck, and suck for a reason.  Now Kobe’s 0-3, despite a nice cutting of the lane, he missed the layup.</p>

<p>At 7:54 PM, the Lakers finally scored with 7:05 remaining, with a Roy Hibbert dunk.  Remember a few years ago when Roy Hibbert nearly led the Pacers to beat the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals?  That was such a distant memory.  Now Hibbert’s as useful as tits on a boar, especially with the game becoming so guard-oriented.  But he has four points, with the Lakers down 6-4 with an ugly start to a game.</p>

<p>At 8:01 PM, I return to my room from the bathroom.  Of course, Kobe hit three of a row in 58 seconds while I was in the bathroom taking care of my bathroom needs.  Now Kobe just hit a long two, and the crowd goes wild, and just hit a three just about 20 seconds later.  By the way, Jay-Z’s in the house, can he at least try to smile?  Next possession, Marcelo Huertas gives the ball the Kobe like he’s supposed to and took an impossible three pointer, which almost went in.  Kobe just wants to shot and put on a show.  He should, he won’t get another chance.  Also, Golden State’s up 27-16 at this point as they seek history, and Steph Curry has 17 already.  He’s a special player to say the least.</p>

<p>At 8:06 PM, we see a video of Kobe announcing coming to the NBA and getting selected in the 1996 Draft by the Hornets.  Thank god the Lakers traded for him.  20 years later, here we are.  No player has spent more years with one team than Kobe; that’s what make Kobe the best Laker of all time, even with all the elite players they’ve had; Magic, Kareem, Wilt, Shaq, James Worthy, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, etc.  Kobe reaches the free throw line for the first time, hitting three free-throws.</p>

<p>And with the first quarter over, Kobe already has more points (15) than he did in his last road game a couple nights ago against Oklahoma City.  He’s scored the team's last 15 points.  And a perfect opportunity to show his new AppleTV commercial with actor Michael B. Jordan.</p>

<p>Second quarter starts at 8:14 PM with buckets from Larry Nance Jr. and Tarik Black(?!?).  Kobe’s on the bench, as the plan is to apparently to play him the whole 1st and 3rd, and half the 2nd and 4th.  Larry Nance Jr. was a decent surprise, high energy guy.  A nice finish by Jordan Clarkson for his first points makes it a 26-25 game. Golden State’s up 44-29 at this point.  Only a miracle would prevent them from losing this game.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they sweep the playoffs.</p>

<p>At 8:22 PM, an interview from the Number 1 Laker Fan of all time: Jack Nicholson, rockin’ the red sunglasses.  One of the few games he missed, the 81 point game!  And the crowd nearly erupted from Larry Nance nearly making a posterizing slam, but he reached the free throw line, but that would have been sweet if he made the dunk.  Nice layup from Marcelo Huertas, and now Kobe goes to the bleachers to get ready to enter the game.  Cheers!  8:26 PM, with 6:14 seconds in the second quarter, after a Utah air-ball, Kobe is back in the game, and quickly chucks a bad three pointer.  He could make those in his prime, but unfortunately, not now.</p>

<p>Back to the action at 8:30PM, with the Lakers down 38-31, and video shows Kobe slapping hands with Shaq.  It’s great to see them two together.  Those were the best times ever in Laker history.  And Kobe with the bucket driving by Gordon Hayward for what would’ve been a slam dunk in his prime, but just a layup.  It’s a shame Kobe tore his achilles in 2013, everything went downhill after that.  Now Kobe has 21 points with the second quarter winding down at 2:45 left in the quarter.</p>

<p>At 8:38PM, a list of people in attendance is mentioned by the announcers; Snoop Dogg, Gary Payton, Baron Davis are the names I remember, all to see Kobe, along with Shaq, Frank Robinson, George Lopez and Jay-Z, along with Jack.  And a sweet behind the back pass from Kobe to Jordan Clarkson leading to a Julius Randle slam was just what the Lakers needed before the half.  And at 8:42PM, the first half comes to an end, with Kobe at 22 points, 8-20 from the field, and the Lakers predictably down 57-42.  At least we get to celebrate something.</p>

<p>And with that, I’m closing up the Live Blog shop for the night.  It’s been a long day for me, and I need to relax for another day of work.  But part two of my season ending Mamba Fest will be here in due time.  Black Mamba and out!</p>
