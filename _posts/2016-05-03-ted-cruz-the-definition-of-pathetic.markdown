intro: "I've seen and read about many bad politicians in my lifetime.  Former Senator Trent Lott, who in 2002 claimed we’d be better off had we voted for racist Senator Strom Thurmond is one.  Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich attempts to sell Obama’s Senate seat and other criminal activities is another.  Former Florida Congressman Mark Foley and his sexually explicit texts to teenage boys was also disturbing, along with the many congressmen and politicians who’ve cheated on their spouses, i.e. Newt Gingrich, Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner.  But despite all those with questionable ethics, criminal policies and downright slanderous misgivings, no politician has or ever will be more pathetic, manipulative, uncooperative or untrustworthy than Senator Ted Cruz."

<p>Ted Cruz was elected as Senator for the ‘great’ state of Texas in 2012, part of the Tea Party’s wave of extremist anti-Obama candidates who think working for him and the Democrats is ‘part of the problem’.  Yet in short time, Ted Cruz has proven that he is self-centered, uncaring for anyone except his followers (though in reality he only cares about himself) and willing to destroy anything in his path just to get his way, alienating virtually all of his fellow Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen in the process.  His extreme hatred for Obamacare was the main culprit, as Ted Cruz became popular amongst extremists and despised by everyone with a brain by partially shutting down the Government in a pathetic attempt to get rid of Obamacare.</p>

<p>With Democrats controlling the Senate and Obama the President, there was no way they would agree to Ted Cruz’s demands to fund the Government without Obamacare.  Ted Cruz surely knew this, as a graduate cum laude at Princeton.  Yet to hear him say it, it was all the Democrats fault for shutting down the Government for two plus weeks, and would have done it again if he could.  Why?  Because they wouldn’t go along with his demands.  As if the Democrats would blindly do something he likes and get nothing in return.  But that is the Republican’s mantra these days, and Ted Cruz is the King of the Obstructionists in congress, the public face of the Tea Party extremists who think all Liberals have to do as they say or else, and should do everything according to the Bible.</p>

<p>Like any politician willing to do whatever to get people on his/her side, Ted Cruz frequently lies about just about everything.  He repeats the same lie over and over again and his fellow supporters will assume it's true, even though anyone who actually researches the topic at hand knows it's completely bogus.  The supporters WANT these things to be true, even when it's clearly the opposite that is true, so they’ll just assume it’s true.  Cruz plays into their fears and into their hands.</p>

<p>One of Cruz’s favorite lies is about Obamacare, which he believes is a catastrophic bill that has done nothing but kill jobs. Problem is, we’ve seen more jobs created since the inception of Obamacare than we’ve lost jobs.  Though the economy was quite bad when Obamacare first passed due to the Recession, it's ridiculous to claim it's killing jobs when the economy has grown since then. Yet Ted Cruz, on a personal mission to do anything to get rid of Obamacare, makes up reasons it's bad, repeating false claims and furthering using his manipulative ways to misinform his followers on what Obamacare actually is.</p

><p>Ted Cruz can easily criticize just about every other politician or wannabe politician, saying ridiculous and often bogus claims, pointing out others flaws, whether true or not and shows little remorse for his words.  But when someone attacks him, my god, someone call the police! Cruz attacks Obama almost daily yet when Obama disagrees with something he suggests, such as the US-Iran deal, Ted Cruz suggests it’s outrageous for Obama to criticize him behind his back, and quote-unquote, should say it to his face, threatening to fight him in the process.  And being locked into a battle with Donald Trump, has managed to take mudslinging to a whole new level.  We need mature candidates, not those who act like fifth graders.  It's unfortunate that we live in the age of trash-talk TV and controversy sells, as Cruz takes advantage of the times by acting childish and idiotic.</p>

<p>But despite all of these characteristics, the thing that is most irritating about Ted Cruz is his narcissistic intolerant attitudes towards others, waging war on those who stand in his way, making false claims about those he doesn't like, and his sincere belief that everything must be done according to the Bible.  These characteristics are more fitting for a terrorist than a politician, yet Ted Cruz continues to attack his enemies as Un-American, wrong on everything and somehow not deserving the same rights as Christians.  Cruz bashes any idea that’s Liberal, claiming most criminals are registered Democrats, which isn’t remotely true.  He claims Muslims are trying to take over the country with Sharia law, and that we need constant surveillance on all Muslim neighborhoods.  Cruz’s answer for this; make everything Christian-like.  But Ted Cruz’s biggest war is against the LGBT community, whom Cruz feels shouldn't have the same rights as Christians, that it's okay for them to be denied services and marriage while claiming Christians are the ones suffering by not being able to deny services to the LGBT community.  Despite the law being against his side and same-sex marriage being legalized, Cruz will try to convince you it's a states right issue and rewrite the Constitution in the process.  Too bad the Supreme Court overruled a ban on interracial marriage back in the day.  Maybe Cruz needs to read up in history rather than try to redefine it.  And now with the battle waging against transsexual bathroom use, Cruz claims keeping them out of their preferred bathrooms will keep little girls safe from grown men.  Too bad this isn't about grown men, it's about transgendered women who will look out of place in a men’s bathroom, as if it’s okay to tell them;  ‘Hey, I’m only in here because of what’s underneath my underwear, come and get me.’ ALL people have rights to live their lives freely, not just Christians. </p>

<p>Ted Cruz has all the qualities of at worst, a terrorist and at best, a controlling husband.  Would he treat his wife the way he treats his fellow congressmen and congresswomen?  It doesn't work in a marriage, why would it work in the Senate?  He thinks he can do whatever he wants and expects everyone to follow him.  People can appreciate him for standing up to their values, but we live in a world that wants results.  Ted Cruz accomplished NOTHING.  All he did was make himself look better, and that’s the only thing Ted Cruz has ever cared about, the man in the mirror.</p>

<p>As I am writing this blog, news broke that Ted Cruz officially dropped out of the race, having been beaten pretty badly in Indiana.  My first two words were: Good Riddance.  My next three words, pardon my language, is: Good Fuckin’ Riddance.  Ted Cruz has been nothing but a complete disaster as a Senator, Presidential candidate, and as a person.  And even though we are left with Donald Trump as the Republican candidate, whose racist comments and ridiculous lies are just as bad if not even worse than Ted Cruz’s, I can truly say that Ted Cruz is far worse than Donald Trump, mainly for being such a religious extremist.  Whether Donald Trump is genuinely pathetic or pretending is in question; it’s not a question for Ted Cruz.  I never thought Ted Cruz would even make it this far, but the result was as predicted, Americans have rejected Ted Cruz the same way his fellow Senators and Congressmen have.  So here’s to you Congressman Peter King, who can get rid of the cyanide he jokingly claimed would take if Cruz won the nomination.  Here’s to you Senator Lindsey Graham, who could very well now shoot Ted Cruz and not get convicted.  Here’s to you Satanists who roundly reject Ted Cruz as a Satanist even though John Boehner referred to him as ‘Lucifer in the Flesh,’ proving that perhaps Ted Cruz is even more evil than Satan himself.  Here’s to those who think Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, you can move on and live your lives freely and in peace.  And of course, to all the American’s who are open to other people’s opinions and respect people who aren’t like them, this one’s for you.  Good bye Ted Cruz.  The fight to completely remove him from public office and out of our lives begins today!</p>
