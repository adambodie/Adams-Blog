        <p class="intro">When I watched Netflix's <a href='http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/entertainment/2016/01/19/making-a-murderer-my-thoughts-on-the-steven-avery-case'>Making a Murderer</a> early in January, the biggest puzzling thing about that case was that Steven
            Avery's nephew Brendan Dassey was convicted of anything at all, much less for the murder of Teresa Halbach based on a clearly coerced confession. As news hit yesterday that a Federal judge in Milwaukee agreed, overturning the conviction, I
            can't help but feel relieved that Dassey got some redemption.</p>

        <p class="intro">For the past two weeks, I've heard the most bizarre stories, all relating to the new super-viral video game that has seemingly taken over the world, Pokemon Go. Pokemon first hit the scene 20 years ago, but this game allows people to try to 'catch-em
            all' based on real-world locations, getting people out and about just to catch Pokemon on their game. It's led to some bizarre stories; people catching criminals, getting stabbed by others, finding dead bodies, guns, etc., getting in car accidents,
            taking up police parking, fire parking, and other bizarre warnings all over Pokemon Go. I played the original Pokemon games when I was a teenager, but now we're seeing adults playing the game; it's pure madness, all these ridiculous real-life
            events happening based solely on this game. Imagine what else this game can lead to. Here's a list of five things I wish this game could find.</p>

        <p class="intro">I was asked to compare two recent movies and Oscar nominated and winning movies from this years Academy Awards. The challenger on the left is The Big Short, which won Best Adapted Screenplay. The champion on the right is Spotlight, which won Best
            Original Screenplay and Best Picture. So which movie did I think was better? Here are my thoughts.</p>

 <h1>Making a Murderer - My Thoughts on the Steven Avery case</h1>

        <p class="intro">Much buzz has surrounded the Netflix film-documentary 'Making a Murderer,' about a Wisconsin man named Steven Avery who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, only to get charged and convicted of murder just two years after his
            release from prison. The show and the case has attracted a lot of attention, getting enough votes for a petition on the White House's website to require the White House to answer the petition (F.Y.I. Obama can't pardon Steven Avery as the
            case was tried in state court, not the federal court). The big question on everyone's mind, did Steven Avery really kill Teresa Halbach, or did someone frame him for exposing corruption for his false conviction? Here are my thoughts on the
            case.</p>
