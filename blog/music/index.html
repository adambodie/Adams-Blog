            <p class="intro">2016 has come and gone, and although there are plenty of things wrong with the hip-hop culture, there are always going to be reasons to actually enjoy it.  Times have changed, and while popular rap is getting dumber and dumber by the moment, the good news is that there is hope.  Here are my thoughts on the year it was.</p>

            <p class="intro">Recently, I read about a viral video of a Christian woman, a mother of four, who blogged her video reaction upon listening to a rap song she heard on the radio, rapping the song line by line and getting upset over the lyrics.  The song in question, Norf Norf, by Vince Staples, is a typical example of a gangsta rap song.  Not surprisingly, the woman was quite offended that this song would appear on the radio, proclaiming the songs of the old days are better for kids.  Not surprisingly, that is simply not true, and there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.</p>

  <h1>XXL Freshmen 2016 - My Thoughts</h1>

  <p class="intro">Every year, XXL magazine, a popular hip-hop magazine, releases its annual 'Freshmen Edition,' highlighting young and promising MCs that XXL believes will become big stars in the game.  Like any 'draft,' some become big stars while others never pan out.  I used to get really excited over these lists, but it peaked in 2010, with dope artists like Freddie Gibbs, J. Cole, Wiz Khalifa, Big Sean, Nipsey Hu$$le and Jay Rock still holding some star power in their own and special way.  Nowadays, the list is a reminder of how much of a decline popular hip-hop is.  I wanted to write this when the list first came out in June, but held off to give myself some time to listen to some of these rappers, none of whom were MC's I loved, and only a few I even had songs from.  So who amongst the 2016 list has any credibility?  Here are my thoughts, starting from top left of their cover.</p>

 <h1>The Day the Music Died Part 3</h1>

        <p class="intro">When people refer to “The Day the Music Died,” they are referring to the tragic death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper when they perished in a plane crash outside of Clear Lake, Iowa on February 3, 1959. Yet years later, we’ve
            lost many musicians with a far bigger influence. With apologies to Elvis Presley, John Lennon, everyone in the “27 Club” (Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and more recently, Amy Winehouse), we’ve seen two deaths in the music world
            truly crushing since that day. The second was of course, Michael Jackson’s tragic death on June 25, 2009, and the third was today, as Prince passed away.</p>

 <h1>Year of the Odd Rap Beef</h1>

        <p class="intro">We're barely into the month of February and already we've seen not one, but two rather bizarre hip-hop beefs, the type you could never imagine ever existing. On the one hand, we have B.o.B. vs. famed Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and now
            we have Ghostface Killah vs. infamous pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli (which has now involved the head of the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform). A rather odd consortium of characters, feuding over the most bizarre
            things. Whose beef is more odd? Here are my thoughts.</p>

 <h1>White Privilege II - Why We Need a Conversation on Race</h1>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p class="author">

        </p>
        <p class="intro">Yesterday, the hip-hop game was jolted by the new song from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, 'White Privilege II,' a vicious track almost nine minutes long that discusses racism in the hip-hop world, in general, the Black Lives Matter movement, and how
            'White America' is at an advantage as opposed to minorities. Though this is not the first time Macklemore has discussed racism in his music; the original White Privilege was a song he released back in 2005, now that Macklemore is famous worldwide,
            the platform is expanded exponentially with his fame, social media and a generation of racism sensitivity. Therefore, more people have a say than they did in 2005, when Macklemore was just a starving underground rapper from Seattle that until
            his unprecedented rise to fame, represented a city whose only taste of mainstream success was Sir Mix-a-Lot and his butt loving song Baby Got Back. While Macklemore will never understand what it's like to actually be a black person (something
            he is completely aware with), this track is important nonetheless as we will never get past racism without talking about it.</p>

 <h1>Hip Hop 2015 - The Year it Was</h1>

        <p class="intro">Another year has gone by, and for an avid hip-hop fan like myself, I can sum up the year in general as mediocre. While Kendrick Lamar continued his onslaught as the most talented rapper at the moment (with apologies to legends like Eminem or Nas,
            who were relatively quiet this year), many of the highly regarded albums in the world of popular rap were filled with syrupy R&amp;B beats and ridiculous R&amp;B singing in their raps (here's looking at you Fetty Wap). While there were plenty
            of rappers with rap albums who actually rap, the most attention still ends up with Drake, whose corny beats, pointless beefs and a collaboration with equally lame rapper Future dominated the news.</p>
