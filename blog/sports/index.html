            <p class="intro">The season's almost over, and there's no margin for error when it comes to finishing the season strong and ending the year on a positive note.  Oregon's not going to make a bowl, but they have two games left to try to pick up the pieces and finish the year on a positive note.  For Mark Helfrich, that could make the difference between remaining as head coach or not.  For the Golden Gophers, seven wins is not enough, eight would be better.  And the playoff race is down to the final stretch, and those who lose will face elimination.</p>

            <p class="intro">It's survival week in Week 11 for the Oregon Ducks, who played against Stanford to have one last shot at turning around their season and making a bowl game, which seemed like a forgone conclusion at the beginning of the season.  For Minnesota, it's the start of Minnesota's true challenges to determine their worth in the Big Ten West, heading to Nebraska to see if they still have an outside shot of winning the West.  How well would this turn out for each team?  How would the playoff chase take shape, in what turned out to be a crazy Playoff Saturday.</p>

But there are more important things than bashing all things USC.  The Gophers played Purdue and with the official playoff rankings out, the chase really begins.</p>

            <p class="intro">Last year, I wrote about the Lakers season one week into the year, with much chagrin, as the Lakers took a while to win.  This season is a completely different story.  Would I call them a playoff team at this point?  Of course not, but there's a much different vibe this year.</p>

Should I even have a favorite player?  How will the brand new Lakers look.  Who's going to win the NBA Championship this year?  How will Kevin Durant adjust to being the villain in Golden State.

            <p class="intro">Week Eight is unofficially Homecoming Week.  For Minnesota, it's their official Homecoming game against Rutgers, their first matchup ever.  For Oregon, it's a painful reminder of how far they've truly fallen against another high powered offensive team in Cal.  That game was played yesterday.  As we reach Week 8, a closer picture starts for determining the four playoff teams.  I'll talk more about that later.</p>

            <p class="intro">Week Seven for me is Strange Week.  The Minnesota Golden Gophers make their way to Maryland to play them for the first time since they joined the Big Ten in 2014.  I'm still not used to them and Rutgers being part of the Big Ten.  Maryland should've remained in the ACC and Rutgers looks like complete crap.  Market aside, the Big Ten should've stopped with Nebraska.  But nonetheless, it's the game against the Terrapins.  As for the Ducks, they stand to have their best defensive performance of the season, as they have the week off.  As for the rest of the week, it seems kind of bland, with the exception of Alabama-Tennessee and Ohio State-Wisconsin.</p>

A list this long would be perfect to describe a proud NFL franchise's Hall of Famers, but no, this is the list of starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns since their franchise was reborn in 1998.  Clearly, the Cleveland Browns are cursed with Quarterbacks.  They're looking for the wrong qualities. Here are the reasons I should be the next starting quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.</p>

            <p class="intro">Week Six for me is Rivalry Week Part 1.  Minnesota hosted Iowa for the Floyd of Rosedale and Oregon hosted Washington, winning twelve in a row against them but looking far worse now than they have at ay time in those twelve years.  As for the the rest of the games, another entertaining variety of match-ups.</p>

            <p class="intro">Week Five has plenty of great matchups, with three top ten conference battles for the first time: Stanford at Washington on Friday, Wisconsin at Michigan and Louisville at Clemson.  Meanwhile, it's the battle for the Governor's Victory Bell for Minnesota as they went to Penn State, while Oregon, after a demoralizing loss last week, head to Washington State, where they hope to avoid last years dysentery affected loss to Washington State</p>

            <p class="intro">Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football.</p>

            <p class="intro">On paper, Week Two looked to be the worst weekend of college football ever.  No ranked teams facing each other, more ranked teams playing FCS weaklings than fellow Power 5 teams, and just one ranked team on the road, #13 Louisville playing at Syracuse in an ACC Showdown.  But life has plenty of surprises, as Week 2 provided more entertainment than on paper.  Week 3 promises to be better in terms of quality matchups, but here are my thoughts on what happened in Week 2.</p>

It should be an exciting year in the NFL, with a lot of notable events in the offseason and plenty of more on the way.  Which team will surprise this year?  Which team will disappoint this year?  Who wins the MVP?  Here's my thoughts on the NFL season on the horizon.</p>

            <p class="intro">Last Friday, during a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Quarterback Colin
                Kaepernick refused to stand for the National Anthem, taking the opportunity to protest racial oppression
                in the United States, and plans to continue his protest until 'real change' progresses. Reaction has not
                surprisingly been mixed, with some praising him for taking a stand while others are criticizing him for
                it. Kaepernick is not the first athlete to use his status to protest civil rights, nor will he be the
                last, but the question remains, will his refusal to stand actually bring any change?</p>

                rest of us. As someone who spent three years at the University of Oregon and one and a half years at the
                University of Minnesota, I have two teams to follow, and as long as they don't play each other, I don't

                new teams. For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like
                they did last year with D'Angelo Russell. While Russell
                wasn't an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype. Who will the Lakers take
                with the number 2 picks. All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be
                announced in 10 minutes.</p>

                had passed away at the age of 74. Though I'm not a boxing fan and I don't know any boxing fans, there
                was always one boxer that everyone knew about, Mr.
                Muhammad Ali. Though some would argue that Mike Tyson is equally famous, he was known for the wrong
                reasons. But Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest, as he frequently claimed, but he was the most
                important athlete of the 20th Century in
                any sport.</p>

            <p class="intro">The NBA Finals have arrived, featuring as I expected, a rematch of last year's Finals,
                Golden State vs. Cleveland. Last year, Cleveland, despite missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, played
                their hardest, gave Golden State a legitimate scare before
                Golden State was able to win their first championship in 40 years. Things have changed slightly this

                much change, finished with an NBA record
                73 wins in the regular season. So who wins the rematch? Here are my thoughts.</p>

    <h1>Steven Adams - A Debate on Whether Exoticness equals Attractiveness</h1>

            <p class="intro">After watching seven games of the Golden State-Oklahoma City series, I have come to the
                conclusion that no matter how talented you are, you need a signature look to gain attention from the
                common-man. Sure, Kevin Durant is quite talented, he shoots
                well and is one of the most feared offensive players in the league, but while I was watching this
                series, it was Steven Adams and his long hair, long mustache and tattoos that got all my attention, as
                well as an interesting back-and-forth
                between my Mom, her boyfriend, my sister and I on whether Adams is good-looking or not.</p>

            <p class="intro">Growing up, I didn't think much of the Los Angeles Clippers. Why should I have? They were a
                complete joke, a bumbling group of losers who couldn't win squat, couldn't put together a decent roster
                and worst of all had an incompetent owner who wouldn't
                spend any money to keep what little talent they had. It wasn't until the other owners handed them Chris
                Paul in an effort to keep him from being traded to the Laker did the Clippers finally start to look like
                a real basketball team. But as
                the Lakers sunk to the floor, have the Clippers overtaken them? Not even close. No matter how talented
                the Clippers are, they’ll always be in second place, and incapable of winning the title. Whether they
                like it or not, they are defined by
                their disgraceful former owner Donald Sterling.</p>

                that could be the case in the first quarter. I would have been happy with 40 points. The plan was to sit
                Kobe the first half of the fourth quarter. That didn’t happen. Suddenly, the race to 50 was on.</p>

            <p class="intro">When it comes to the NBA, there are two types of players who dominate; players with amazing
                skills and smarts, and players with an unmatched physical advantage, players I like to call ‘a physical
                freak of nature.’ While players like Michael Jordan
                and Kobe Bryant will come and go, the physical freaks are rarer, and though not all players in the
                category are elite, the ones who do are able to use their advantageous attributes effectively and
                skillfully. Today, it comes as no surprise
                that Shaquille O’Neal, a man who needs no introduction, was selected to join the Basketball Hall of
                Fame. There was never a player like Shaq when he was playing, and with the changing of the style of play
                in professional basketball, there
                will probably never be a player as dominant and larger-than-life as Shaq, both physically and
                verbally.</p>

                ever. High seeds including West Virginia (3), California (4) and multiple 5 seeds, Purdue and Baylor
                were upset as well. My upset picks didn’t pan out, except for Gonzaga over Seton Hall and VCU over
                Oregon State, but not nearly as impressive

                Johnny Manziel. The Vikings needed a quarterback, but Johnny Manziel was not only a terrible fit for the

                but cocky player. There are quite a few people that find Cam Newton obnoxious and arrogant, whether it's
                his me-first attitude or his 'Dab' dancing whenever he scores a touchdown. But on the other hand, how
                can you hate someone with a smile

                play for big time college basketball
                teams, which is why, when the New York Knicks selected a young Latvian kid named Kristaps Porzingis,

                the horse logo (what would you expect, I was young
                and loved the animal logos, even the Toronto Raptors Dinosaur logo which, like Detroit's logo then

                Portland Trail Blazers, that of the great Arvydas
                Sabonis. I even got a throwback jersey of Dr. J from the Philadelphia 76ers. But there's one jersey

    <h1>USC - My Anti-Christ</h1>

            <p class="intro">Today marks another edition of Oregon vs. USC. This should be just another game. But for
                me, I consider myself the unofficial President of the 'I Hate USC' Club, perhaps just the President of
                the Portland Chapter of the 'I Hate USC' Club. It shouldn't
                have to be this way, but yet I passionately hate USC more than any football program in college sports.
                Not schools like Oregon State and Washington, nor schools like Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan, rival
                schools of Oregon (where I started)
                and Minnesota (where I graduated). But yet, it's USC that makes me puke the most. With apologies to my
                Uncle Fred and cousin Kimmy, two USC graduates who actually show me love and respect (even from afar),
                here's a time-line of my hatred for
                USC.</p>

    <h1>Why Tracy Claeys is the Right Choice for the Golden Gophers</h1>

            <p class="intro">Two weeks ago, Jerry Kill, the football coach of the Gophers, retired due to health
                concerns. It seemed as if Minnesota would plummet to mediocrity yet again. But despite the loss of Kill,
                the program made leaps and bounds in terms of success,
                fan appreciation and continuity while he was there. Fanfare was much higher than it was when I went
                there in 2006, with JerrySota becoming a common phrase for Gopher fans. They had two choices: Keep
                things the way it was and retain trusty
                defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys as its coach, or go in a different direction. Choosing continuity
                over uncertainty, Minnesota made the right choice to keep Claeys as Head Coach.</p>

    <h1>The 2015-2016 Los Angeles Lakers - One week in the Season</h1>

            <p class="intro">One week into the season, the Lakers are winless (0-4) and have not looked impressive as a
                whole. Am I that surprised? Of course not. Does the Lakers future look bright? I'd say yeah, not this
                year, but a couple years down the road, the Lakers
                will be contending again.</p>
