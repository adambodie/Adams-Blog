<p>A week from today, the college football season ends with the national championship game between #1 Clemson and #2 Alabama.  A fitting championship game between the two best teams in the country.  Seeing Clemson slow down Oklahoma's high powered offense and Alabama completely shutting Michigan State down, it's clear these two were on a collision course for quite some time.  So who wins the big game?  Here are my two cents.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/clemson.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Clemson Quarterback DeShaun Watson." class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>Clemson Quarterback DeShaun Watson</h4>
</div>

<p>To make things clear, I'm rooting for Clemson in this match-up.  I can't stand Alabama and especially coach Nick Saban, the president of the 'Let's try to kill Oregon's high speed offense by whining the the Rules Committee Club.'  Nick Saban can complain that it affects safety, despite a lack of evidence.  He can compare it to smoking cigarettes.  But a great coach would be up to the challenge of stopping such an offense.  While people laugh as his vice-president, Arkansas coach Bret Bielema, Nick Saban acts high and mighty walking around as if the college football universe revolves around him.  The SEC as a whole is like this, and Nick Saban personifies this.</p>

<p>I also like Clemson as they are located in South Carolina, where my Bodie roots are, and from what I can tell, at least some of my family there are Tiger fans.  Plus my Grandpa back in the day always enjoyed watching the Clemson-South Carolina game.  But there's more to Clemson to root for this year: They are 14-0, trying to become the first college football team to finish the season 15-0.  That would be a big accomplishment when it's hard enough as it is to go 13-0, let alone 14-0.  So will this be the year Clemson accomplishes history or will they revert to their old 'Clemsoning' days?</p>

<p>Offensively, Clemson has more threats than Alabama, including their star QB DeShaun Watson, a dual threat quarterback that can give Alabama's defense fits.  Against Oklahoma, he was hitting on all cylinders, on the ground and through the air (though it wasn't until the second half until Clemson started to pull away).  Alabama has Heisman winning RB Derrick Henry, a talented runner and a top priority for Clemson, but Alabama also has wide receivers to throw to as well, as Michigan State learned the hard way in the Cotton Bowl.  With a plethora of options for Clemson, they have the slight edge.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>Alabama Running Back Derrick Henry</h4>
</div>

<p>Defensively, Alabama gets all the credit for its hard nose tackling and for slowing games down, but Clemson also has a great defense that deserves credit.  But as in the past, Alabama has struggled at times against dual threat quarterbacks.  While Watson isn't the fastest, he is smart.</p>

<p>Coaching wise, this is Clemson coach Dabo Swinney's first National Championship game.  After years of coming close and choking at the wrong time, a phenomenon that's become known as 'Clemsoning,' Dabo, with his most complete team ever, will pour his heart and soul into the game.  Nick Saban, the Alabama coach, has been in this position multiple times as a head coach, and knows what it takes to win the big game.</p>

<p>So who wins the big game?  Clemson was viewed as an underdog against Oklahoma and won easily, now they come into this game as an underdog as well.  The disrespect card is clearly enough to motivate Clemson.  Alabama claims disrespect after losing to Ohio State in last year's playoff.  It will be a great matchup, but in the end, my prediction is that Clemson wins 24-17.</p>
