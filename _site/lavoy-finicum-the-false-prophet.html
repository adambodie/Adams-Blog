<p>The standoff at the Malheur Wildlife Refuge has come and gone, but yet people are still fascinated by it. One story particularly disturbing is the case of LaVoy Finicum, the group’s unofficial spokesman who was the only casualty of the standoff. Supporters of his pathetic cause say he was murdered by the FBI. The official story stands that he was killed justifiably as he threatened to kill the cops in his way. Whatever the case, LaVoy Finicum does not deserve any pity at all. He got exactly what he deserved.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>If it acts like a terrorist and talks like a terrorist, he must be a terrorist</h4>
</div>

<p>Finicum had no problem expressing his beliefs of defying authority and threatening suicide-by-cop, wanting to be some sort of martyr.  Based on his followers protesting his death and people protesting in Pioneer Courthouse Square in his defense, along with those protest around the country, he got what he wanted.  But yet, these same people overlook the fact that he was nothing more than an Anti-Government terrorist wanting something that wasn’t legally his.  Would these same people have reacted as such if he was Islamic?  Hardly, they would have slapped him with a ‘Terrorist’ label and treated him as an enemy, not some folk-hero fighting the big guy.  Apparently, there’s no such thing as a white terrorist in many people's eyes; they’re called something different: militant, anti-government protester, etc.</p>

<p>Of course, as a rural white gun-toting American, LaVoy Finicum acted like he was victim, being oppressed by the big bad government for making him pay grazing fees.  But every American has to pay the government in one way or another, it’s called taxes.  You simply can’t tell the government that you no longer will follow its rules without facing the consequences: they're call rules.  You have to respect the Government and not fight them to the death as he did.  He clearly told FBI agents to ‘go ahead and shoot him’ and as a gun-toting false Patriot, he was armed to the tooth and nail.  That’s the only reason the standoff was able to last as long as it did, because they threatened everyone with guns.  Even though he made numerous references to this, people treat him like some sort of prophet who died to protect them.  But really, he was a coward who wants everything for free, just like his idiot leader Cliven Bundy, who hates the Government and believes they have no authority, yet has no problem accepting a Government-funded public defenders.  Where does the money come from to pay these attorneys?  The government.</p>

<p>So while many claim Robert ‘LaVoy’ Finicum is a martyr, really he was nothing more than some anti-government terrorist who actively sought to take them down to bend the rules in his favor so he could make more profit from his grazing for free.  He blatantly broke the law with all of his scumbag buddies by holding a federal wildlife refuge hostage and threatening to shoot those who tried to stop them, and when the FBI caught them in their tracks, Finicum threatened to shoot the cops and was killed for not complying.  These are not characteristics of a hero, but actually characteristics of a terrorist, just like the radical Islamic terrorist groups that many of his followers assume are the only terrorists around.  Another case of being blinded by skin color.</p>
