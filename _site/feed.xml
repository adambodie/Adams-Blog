        <title>Liar Liar, Pant is on Fire</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; People lie, doesn't matter who you are.  But some people lie more than others.  This year, lying has become the new truth-telling, as the Republican candidate for President, whose name won't be mentioned, lies about, well, basically everything.  This is coming from a man who believes it's okay to lie and does so repeatedly and often as possible.  A man so deluded in himself that he complains a mass conspiracy every time someone tells him what he's saying is lying.  He even claims Ted Cruz as the biggest liar of all time with the nickname Lyin' Ted (to be fair, they are both ridiculous liars). With that said, tonight is the first Presidential debate, and one thing is for certain: this Idiot will frequently lie.  If a drinking game would be made out of it, all participants would die of alcohol poisoning. Here's a live look at lie upon lie upon lie..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton-donald-trump.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;The debate&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;One's great, one's stupid.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:03 PM - The first Presidential debate is started by moderator Leslie Holt, who announces it's sponspored by a non-partisan committee.  The Idiot previously thought the Democrats controlled it because the Falcons-Saints game is playing.  And here come Hillary in Red, and the Idiot with a blue tie.  Ironic colors for both of them.  Now we get the opening statement about acheiveing prosperity, mainly jobs.  Hillary Clinton first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:06 PM - Hillary talks first about the economy, and looking at the Idiot, he looks like a grumpy pompous ass while he's listening.  After acknowledging him, he showcases his ugly chin.  He's effin' ugly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:08 PM - And now for the Idiot.  He talks about stealing jobs, but he's done plenty of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:10 PM - Hillary responds by calling the Idiot's economic plan as Trumped Up trickle down (I think), the most extreme ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:12 PM - The Idiot is talking about his small loan in 1975 of $1,000,000 dollars, which was much more in value than it is today.  With inflation, that's like $10,000,000.  Jenn just told me he's snifling a lot.  Now I noticed it.  He claims Hillary didn't do enough, but it's a too party street.  Hello?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:14 PM - The moderator asked him to actually answer the question, which he didn't answer.  Jenn's right, he's snifling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:15 PM - Hillary mentions the Recession as the primary reason for such jobs leaving.  After she mentioned the Idiots desire to profit off the collapse, he said &quot;That's business.&quot;  This is not business, it's being the President.  Idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:16 PM - The Idiot said he never said that global warming is a hoax.  It's all over his Twitter page.  Another case of &quot;I didn't say this even though I clearly did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump5.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:18 PM - The Idiot claims Obama's doubled the debt, but we were already in debt.  He asks Hillary why she hasn't come up with any solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:19 PM - Hillary has been thinking about it, but not for 30 years she joked.  It's not up all to her by herself.  He interrupts with remarks about NAFTA and then drinks some water.  Whoop dee doo.  What an Idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:21 PM - He keeps complaining about NAFTA, talking about devastation.  Hillary mentions him living in his own reality twisting her words.  He keeps interrupting about &quot;Is this Obama's fault?&quot;  He told Hillary he has no plan, but she mentions her plan clear and available in stores and at the airport, called Stronger Together.  He has no plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:23 PM - He's proud of the biggest tax plan cut since Ronald Reagan.  Reagan raised taxes.  He talks about regulations upon regulations, but regulations make companies play the level field.  He said Bigly two times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton4.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:24 PM - The Idiot says his things are Facts.  They are clearly not Facts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:25 PM - The Idiot says she shouldn't announce her plans to fight ISIS and claims she's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life.  Last time I checked, ISIS was founded in 2004.  Hillary is not 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:27 PM - The Idiot says 5 trillion dollars can't be brought in due to bureaucratic red tape.  That's likely a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:28 PM - The Idiot says &quot;Why not?&quot; as Hillary said she'll likely to be blamed for everything tonight.  Lester Holt told him to let her answer her question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump3.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:29 PM - Hillary talked about the Trump Loophole, a so-called name that his tax cuts would benefit his family.  He keeps interrupting her.  He wants his word even though it's her turn to talk.  What a loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 PM - The Idiot claims she's all talk and no action.  He claims the worst economical revival since the Depression.  The economy hasn't been as bad since the depression.  Big hole to dump.  The moderator talks about his tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:31 PM - The Idiot claims a routine audit about his taxes.  He talks about his financial statement, but it's not a complete picture.  Release your taxes Idiot, it's clear you're hiding something.  The moderator mentions the IRS won't disallow him.  He complains about all the years under audit, it's because you're a fraud who's been sued so many times.  Now he's talking about her deleted emails, childish threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:34 PM - Hillary talks about the reasons he won't release his tax returns, and referred to as a Bait and Switch.  Who cares about her emails?  She talked about her emails, but interrupted again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:36 PM - The Idiot claims it was on purpose and illegal.  It was not illegal, just naive.  He claims you learn more about financial disclosures than tax returns.  But you don't get your tax rates.  Stupid!  He talks about knowing about money, but he filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy 6 times.  He claims our country in a mess and called us a third world country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:39 PM - Hillary wants to talk about his business and all the people he's stiffed for money.  His response: he didn't do a good job.  You still have to pay regardless of whether you like it or not.  It's called a contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:41 PM - The Idiot talks about words.  But that's all he is...words.  No action.  He said he paid the contractors but said he didn't paid them earlier.  He sniffles his nose again.  Now he talks about about making something under budget.  Sure, and I wear a bra.  The Moderator says we're really behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump4.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:44 PM - Now we're on to race issues.  Hillary's up first, talking about the tragedies in Tulsa and Charlotte.  Again, actual ideas about the criminal justice system and trust within the community, with both minoriites and the police.  It does need to be a mutual decision.  And yes, gun violence is a big factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:46 PM - Now the Idiot talks about Law and Order.  He talks about a large support of policemen.  He talks about African Americans and Hispanics living in hell, with 'thousands' of shootings in Chicago this year.  Again, he has no idea to stop this.  He blames Obama for all of this violence and wants racist Stop and Frisk policies.  He has no ideas to stop this.  Stop and Frisk was declared unconstitutional because of racist tendencies, but the Idiot claims the judge is biased.&lt;/p&gt;
his career.  She talks about his lawsuits from the 70's about his racist behavior.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton1.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:49 PM - The Idiot doesn't get it.  He keeps talking about Obama's presidency.  But violence is always been bad, it didn't start in 2009.  And he wants Stop and Frisk so cops can profile Blacks and Hispanics.  We need law and order without racial profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:51 PM - Hillary mentions how the Idiot has such a grim view of the inner cities.  She talks about having actual ideas, while all he can say is &quot;Law and Order.&quot;  All words.  If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:54 PM - Hillary talks about how everyone is implicitly racially biased.  Well said, it's not just a police issue.  We need officers retrained.  She mentioned mental health, which is always overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:55 PM - The Idiot claims the NRA are good people.  They are corrupt and only interested in gun.  Now he mentioned the term super-predator which she said years ago.  He claims stop and frisk brought murders down in NYC from 2,000 to 500.  That's bogus, and it had little impact.  She responds that crime is still down in NYC, he interrupts that it's not.  The Idiot's stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:58 PM - The Idiot claims Democrats are abusing African Americans for votes.  Republicans are trying to keep them from voting with voting right restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:59 PM - Hillary got applause for saying she's preparing to be President.  Now he's asked about Obama's birthplace.  He's wasting his time talking about Hillary's role.  He doesn't want to talk about it.  She had nothing to do with that.  The moderator mentions he continued to claim he wasn't from Hawaii.  By the way, Obama did produce his birth certificate before he became President.  The Idiot is so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:02 PM - Hillary wisely points that the birther lie was racist, and tells the truth about what really happened.  It was how he started his career.  She talks about his lawsuits from the 70's about his racist behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton3.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:05 PM - The Idiot is again lying about the Birther claim.  Hillary's team had nothing to start the Birther theory.  He's lying again.  Another section begins, security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:06 PM - Once again, Hillary talks about two types of cyber criminals, including the Russian hacks of our countries organizations.  She's mentioned the Idiot's praise of Vladimir Putin.  He scoffs as if he doesn't praise Vladimir Putin.  She says it's one of their prime methods.  She mentions his asking for Putin to hack into her emails while he shakes his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump1.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:09 PM - Now the Idiot talks about more endorsements from Admirals and Navymen.  Sure...  And he talks about the political hacks running, probably because they support Hillary Clinton.  He's not answering the question, he's talking about the hacked emails themselves about Bernie Senders.  And ISIS is learning lots of internet stuff, including his words against Islam.  Once again, he's blaming the government for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:11 PM - More talking from Hillary about a plan to defeat ISIS, and obviously, she isn't going into the specifics, like the Idiot claims it.  And she knows we need to go after Baghdadi, the leader.  The moderator mentions the American citizens committing terrorist attacks.   American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:13 PM - The Idiot mentions Obama and Hillary creating ISIS.  Wrong.  He claims they created ISIS.  Wrong.  He talks about the oil we didn't take.  That's illegal.  He claims he never supported the Iraq War.  Wrong!  The Idiot said it's wrong that he supported the Iraq war, three times.  She mentioned Bush's agreement to leave Iraq.  Not Obama.  Bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton6.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary CLinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:16 PM - Hillary talks about allies, mentioning how the Idiot frequently insults Muslims.  He's so stupid.  Idiot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:17 PM - The Idiot talks about the Middle East is a total mess.  It's always been a mess.  He claims it's common sense that NATO needs to pay off.  He still isn't answering the question about home-grown terror or even mentioned it.  ISIS was formed in 2004, not in 2012.  Hello?  He wants to take them out quickly.  It's not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:19 PM - He again denies he supported the war in Iraq.  He claims the record is not right, that he's always right.  He said, &quot;Yeah sure&quot; to Howard Stern.  Sean Hannity is a hack.  He told him his views after Howard Stern.  He's complaining about the media.  He's lying again.  The moderator mentions he's making mere judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:24 PM - Hillary's talking with experience, mentioning actual policies and getting things done.  The Idiot, not so much.  He's so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:26 PM - The Idiot says Obama is her president.  He says global warming is not the greatest threat.  He's the president of the United States.  And with NATO, he only cares about getting paid.  He's so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:31 PM - I'm getting worn out by this debate.  At least Hillary is smart enough to bring some intelligence to the conversation.  The Idiot keeps talking about her creating ISIS.  They didn't create ISIS.  He wants to help allies, but wants them to pay up.  He keeps talking about his business ability.  This is the Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:33 PM - Now he's taking about Hillary's stamina.  He's arguing with the moderator over wording.  This has nothing to do with stamina.  Pretty sexist.  She mentions all her experience.  He claims it's bad experience.  We didn't give Iran 150 million dollars for nothing.  Stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton5.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary CLinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:36 PM - The Idiot claims no one feels sorry for the things he said about Rosie O'Donnell.  He claims her ads are 'not nice' and 'not true.'  He's talking about the polls.  At last, the final statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:37 PM - Hillary says the election is about us, to vote, not about them.  Same question for the Idiot, who talks about deporting people becoming citizens with some nonsense.  Finally, the debate's over.  Next up, the debates on October 9.  Thank god it's over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Four Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/quack.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Quack&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Darren Carrington putting new meaning to quacking like a duck after a touchdown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Minnesota needed overtime to win at Colorado State, as Mitch Leidner led the Golden Gophers to a fourth quarter comeback before ultimately winning the game.  This time around, Minnesota led most of the game and were able to hold off Colorado State, with a 31-24 win, to finish their non-conference schedule 3-0.  Shannon Brooks, the team's leading rusher last year made his season debut after missing the first two games with a foot injury.  The Gophers were able to rush the ball for 243 yards in total, with all four touchdowns on the ground.  Their running game, plus a tough defense, makes the Gophers a tough out for their conference foes.  Also to note, Tai'yon Devers now has three tackles this year, all sacks causing fumbles that the Gophers recovered.  He knocked the crap out of Colorado State QB Collin Hill, knocking his helmet off in the process.  Making the most of his work to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the non-conference schedule is over, Minnesota must make improvements in their passing game in order to contend.  They've made strides but need consistency from Leidner and the wide receivers.  The Big Ten West appears to be wide open, with last year's champ Iowa not playing as well as advertised.  They didn't look particularly good against Rutgers, winning 14-7.  Wisconsin and Nebraska look better than projected, with wins between LSU, Michigan State and Oregon between the two teams.  Minnesota realistically needs to win two out of those three matchups to contend, and with Nebraska and Wisconsin on the road, that task becomes tougher.  In the meantime, they need to win their first road game of the season (and first conference game) against Penn State, where the Governors Victory Bell is on the line.  A winnable game by all means but Beaver Stadium is a tough place to play, and Minnesota's only won two games there, the last win in 2003)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
        		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/EMU-protest.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;EMU&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
        		&lt;h4&gt;Eastern Michigan protesters after the game.&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;Some things are more important than football, and that was clear in last night's game between Eastern Michigan and Wyoming, as protesters, upset with racist graffiti found on campus buildings earlier in the week, took to the field after the game chanting &quot;No Justice, No Peace.&quot;  I feel it's important to speak up about issues, and Eastern Michigan University, which supports the protesters rights, should be applauded for listening.  As long as the message isn't lost in translation and no violence comes as a result, this type of action is approved.  Since Colin Kaepernick stopped standing for the National Anthem, it's become a big topic, and unfortunately, those who don't support his actions don't understand what he (and others who have followed) are actually protesting.  That's another topic which I've previously discussed, but Eastern Michigan should be applauded for the way they've handled the response.  Talking about them just gives me an excuse to mention their town, Ypsilanti, which is up there with Kalamazoo as one of the most interesting city names in Michigan (and the United States in general).  It also means I've mentioned each directional Michigan school in just four weeks; Western Michigan, Central Michigan, and now, Eastern Michigan (in that order).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oregon opened its conference schedule against Colorado, who's looked a lot better than in years past, but unfortunately for the Buffaloes, their starting quarterback Sefo Liufau is out with an ankle injury.  On the flip side, Royce Freeman didn't play for the Ducks, but they have plenty of talented running backs behind him; Tony Brooks-James, Kani Benoit and Taj Griffin.  The hype before the game were Oregon's new uniforms, featuring green shirts, white pants and orange socks and shoes, to resemble an actual duck.  Hard to believe they never thought of that all these years but it's a nice and clever look, I enjoyed their jerseys.  As for the game itself, Oregon's defense struggled in the first half to stop Colorado's offense, with backup QB Steven Montez looking like a stud in his first start.  Sefo Who?  The Autzen Stadium crowd, along with every Oregon fan watching, was stunned that Colorado led for most of the first half.  But much like the Buffaloes game last week against Michigan, where they similarly jumped out to a big first half lead, the Ducks came back to take the lead late in the third quarter with two turnovers leading to Oregon touchdowns.  But in the end, Colorado won 41-38 as Dakota Prukop threw his first interception of the year at the worst time to seal the loss for Oregon.  Safe to say, their defense is completely broken, as I feared would be the case.  This one will sting, but congrats to Colorado for finally getting a quality Pac-12 conference win, unfortunately it came against the Ducks.  Next up, a road trip to Washington State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Tennessee's Smokey uniforms.  Good or Bad?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Former Baylor President Kenneth Starr said today that former coach Art Briles was treatly unfairly in regards to Baylor's sexual assault scandal.  Regardless of whether that's true or not, Kenneth Starr treated Bill Clinton unfairly for prosecuting the sham Monica Lewinsky scandal which had no effect on the United States, yet felt it was the single most important issue in our country leading to an obviously politically motivated impeachment.  Shame on you, Kenneth Starr --- Tennessee wore their smokey gray uniforms against Florida.  I'm not quite sure if I like them or not, they stand as a complete contrast to their bright orange jerseys.  As for the game, they rallied from a 21-3 deficit to beat Florida 38-28.  Maybe they're better than I thought.  Not Top Ten good, but we'll see.  I've never had any issues with the Tennessee Volunteers, plus I have some family nearby, so I'll give them credit. --- LSU was this close to beating Auburn, with a miracle touchdown, but they didn't get the play off in time.  Classic Les Miles, always poor with clock management.  I can only chuckle. --- With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Who Killed JonBenét?</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Twenty years ago, the night after Christmas, six year old JonBenét Ramsey was found murdered in her home, in what has become a bizarre and fascinating case, from the rambling ransom note to the suspicion on the family, there are many odd things about the case that makes it unusual.  Yet after 20 years, no one really knows what happened.  Recently, a new investigator team, with new technology, reanalyzed the evidence and discussed their findings on a CBS special.  So with that all said, who killed JonBenét Ramsey?  Here are all my possible theories, complete with their likelihood of it happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jonbenet-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;JonBenét&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Mark Karr killed her.  He confessed to the crime, but no evidence linked him to it.  The likelihood that he killed her:  0%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burke Ramsey accidentally killed her.  Burke Ramsey, now 29, recently talked to Dr. Phil about the case, and he came across as socially awkward.  And despite the parents claim he was asleep at the time they called 911, a young voice was heard on the phone after Patsy thought she hung up the phone (she didn't) with updated technology, possibly saying “What did you find?”  I doubt a nine year old would intentionally kill his little sister, but if he was awake, why didn't they make that claim to begin with when he could’ve been awake without committing a crime?  In order for this theory to be true, someone needed to cover the crime, which his parents would have every reason to do.  Clearly, the ransom note was not written by Burke.  But at the same time, he apparently had a temper and hit her on the head with a golf club when she was four.  But that's not indicative of a killer; he was too young to understand.  They also found two dots on her back that might have matched train tracks, which he could’ve used, but doesn’t necessarily mean he did use them.  Also found at the scene was a bowl of pineapple and tea with Burke’s fingerprints, which becomes significant because JonBenét had undigested pineapple in her intestine when they found her.  It’s possible Burke hit her in the head with the flashlight over a pineapple squabble; the flashlight head perfectly fit the skull fracture they found, but it’s not the only reason to accidentally kill someone and anyone could’ve used it.  The likelihood of Burke killing her accidentally: 35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patsy Ramsey killed her.  Two theories tie in to this scenario.  One: she got in a fit of rage, and two: she was mad at her husband and wanted him to pay for it.  The police had her submit five writing samples as they suspected she wrote the ransom note due to similar handwriting and found her fingerprints on the pad and pen.  The new investigators analyzed the note and believe a woman wrote it based on the language.  Her 911 call was incredibly off, as her apparent grief seemed fake, especially with the conversation overheard accidentally showed her incredibly calm.  And her and John refused to talk to the police for a while, not to mention the fact they had friends over while the crime scene was being investigated.  That in itself is a sign of trying to destroy evidence.  Something was never right with Patsy, and while it’s true she pushed JonBenét with all the pageantry stuff, it is possible she snapped from various reasons, whether it was jealousy or perfectionism.   The likelihood of Patsy killing her: 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/burke-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Burke&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Burke Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Ramsey killed her.  John Ramsey acted weird, running straight for the basement when the police told him they needed to search the house top to bottom.  And he planned to leave shortly after they found JonBenét deceased.  That seems a bit odd, but wouldn't explain the ransom note that made him the target.  At the very least, he was involved in the so-called cover-up.  The likelihood he killed her: 5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patsy Ramsey hired someone to kill her.  The DNA found on JonBenét’s body did not match her immediate family.  That ruled them out as official suspects, but that doesn't mean they weren't involved in her death.  Assuming Patsy wrote the note, she could have had someone enter the house to kill JonBenét, but if money was the object, why wasn't she actually kidnapped?  Perhaps a struggle ensued and the hired killer took things too far by striking her while Patsy wrote the ransom note.  On the other hand, the broken glass theory seemed unlikely, someone probably would've heard it and cobwebs were found intact, as the window was allegedly broken by John months prior.  There was no break-in, so someone else who may have entered the house had to have been let in.  It makes no sense for them to enter through the basement window based on the evidence.  Patsy is the most likely to do this.  The lack of footprints outside in the snow is harder to get explain under this theory, but everything else potentially works.  The probability of Patsy hiring someone to kill her: 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Ramsey hired someone to kill her.  It’s highly unlikely that this is a possibility as John Ramsey had little motive to kill JonBenét, but you never know, he could've had a double life and seeked an escape, but that would require killing the whole family.  The likelihood of John hiring someone to kill her: 2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complete stranger killed her.  There are plenty of sexual predators out there, and one of them could've easily slipped in the door and committed the crime.  Of course, without no forced entry, the only way this is possible is if the door was unlocked.  Otherwise, there would've been evidence of a break-in.  But anything is possible.  There are plenty of people that would have had an unhealthy lust for her since she was in beauty pageants all prettied up.  But why write a ransom note inside with the exact amount of John’s bonus?  Who knew that number besides the family itself.  And since the ransom note suggests a cover-up, why cover up a complete stranger.  The likelihood of a complete stranger killing her: 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/patsy-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Patsy&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Patsy Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things to consider when making the determination as to who killed JonBenét.  There was no break-in or footprints (they found one but not conclusive), which highly suggests the killer was already in the house.  Though it’s possible a stranger found a key and entered the house without a break-in, it doesn't completely explain the ransom note.  A true ransom note wouldn't have been written as long nor on pad of paper found in the house.  Even more damaging to the legitimacy of the ransom note was that JonBenét was found dead in the basement.  That's not a kidnapping.  This further suggests that her killer was one of her family members.  But which member was it?  Burke, Patsy or John?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little evidence to conclude that John Ramsey was the killer.  The ransom note was targeted at him and didn't sound like he wrote it.  He appears to be a family loving businessman and nothing else.  The motive isn't there.  That just leaves Patsy and Burke as the two most likely perpetrators.  Both had the ability to kill JonBenét, whether intentional or not.   There’s certainly a reason to believe a cover up occurred, as a grand jury voted to indict John and Patsy for charges related to her murder, but ultimately the DA declined to press charges.  But who had more of a motive to have a crime covered up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to believe Burke was the killer.  He acted bizarre over the whole ordeal, and his parents apparently lied about him being asleep at the time they called 911.  They spent their lives protecting him and wanting him to have a normal life.  Plus with a tendency to have a temper, it was possible to hit her in a rage.  It would perfectly explain the ransom note as a means to bring attention away from him.  But at the same time, any awkwardness shown in his psychiatry visits doesn’t necessarily suggest that said awkwardness was due to killing her.  Maybe he witnessed the attack that left JonBenét Ramsey dead, and the reason the parents said he was asleep was to keep him from testifying.  That is also possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the most likely suspect is Patsy Ramsey.  The way she acted during the 911 call was not what you'd expect from someone who lost a child.  She sounded too calm and likely would've shown a tad more emotion if it was Burke rather than herself.  She pushed JonBenét hard with the pageantry and perhaps got jealous of the attention she received and snapped.  She invited friends over while police were investigating the crime scene and wouldn't speak to the police, speaking to CNN first.  Even then, the way she spoke of JonBenét after she died struck me as someone who killed her, rather than someone protecting her son who killed her.  She said things like “I loved that child,” which lacks empathy to me.  John Ramsey was a loving husband and would’ve easily protected his wife if said attack was not intentional.  There certainly are problems with this theory, but it makes more sense than Burke being the killer.  Sure, Burke was weird, and still is weird, but he could've always been like that.  He appeared to be jealous of the attention JonBenét got, but that didn’t mean he actually killed her.  Plus, he was nine years old.  He would’ve never been criminally charged with her death, as he was too young.  But Patsy would’ve faced murder/manslaughter charges if she was in fact the killer.  She would’ve face prison time and that would’ve destroyed the family fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/john-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;John&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;John Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing for certain is that the family never wanted this case solved.  They used their money and influence to keep the investigation grounded, and did everything else to wipe out and destroy evidence.  Had the police officers and FBI had not messed up the initial investigation, chances are, the crime would’ve been solved 20 years ago.  In this essence, all three Ramsey’s were involved in her death and only have themselves to blame.  Protecting themselves at the expense of JonBenét is sad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Skittles - A Poor Analogy to Describe Humanity</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Today, Donald Trump Jr., son of the racist bigot Idiot whom he's named after, again proved that racism is learned, much like his racist father and grandfather, by making this ridiculous analogy about Syrian refugees: &quot;If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you.  Would you take a handful?&quot;  Aside from being moronic and overly simplistic, statements like this are a perfect example of why racial profiling is flat out wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Skittles.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Skittles&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Skittles, just candy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mars, Incorporated, the makers of Skittles pointed out, &quot;Skittles are candy; refugees are people.&quot;  Anyone who wants to treat human beings as candy is purely stupid and ignorant.  Skittles are all made the same way, have the same ingredients, the only difference is their color and taste.  But even amongst those flavors, each flavor is made the same and are supposed to be the same.  Two yellow Skittles are the same.  Two red Skittles are the same as well.  Human beings on the other hand, are complex individuals with unique DNA, personality and other characteristics that makes them one unique human being (twins aside, but that's an exception to the rule, not a commonality).  A human being with brown hair, white skin and green eyes is always going to be different from another human being with brown hair, white skin and green eyes due to the complexity of human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating people like candy is the perfect metaphor for racial profiling.  By definition, racial profiling is judging people based on characteristics.  Most times, it's a person's negative characteristics that's used for racial profiling.  It doesn't matter how good a person is, to some, it's better to assume they might be bad to catch the bad ones than it is to treat them all as good and let a bad one get through.  This might work with candy; if a bad batch is made, you can simply throw it out and make a new batch, but this doesn't work with human beings.  You can't simply recycle or throw away human beings like you would with candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of a few cannot be used to judge an entire group of people.  It's not true about candy nor is it excuse to discriminate against other human beings.  Yet some claim it's the only way to stop terrorism.  A better way is to do what we currently do, judge each person individually, not judge them based on perceived characteristics which may or may not be true about said individual. That way, a person can be judge by all of their characteristics, not just their appearance.  Unfortunately, some people will often harbor negative feelings towards someone solely based on the color of their skin.  In the case of Syrian refugees, it's based solely on their Islamic faith, which some people make their decision primarily based on skin color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's always the chance someone falls through the cracks; there's nothing we can do to stop that.  But that doesn't mean we can't deny rights to the many that are good hard-working human beings.  After all, the defining characteristic of a person with the intent to commit a crime is not their skin color, nationality nor religion, it's their intent to commit a crime.  Racial profiling does nothing but lead people to only be on the lookout for a certain group of people.  Any person is capable of committing a crime.  But while racists will judge a terrorist like Ahmad Rahami of being representative of all Muslims, these same people will not make the same comparison for terrorists like Dylann Roof to all white people.  To them, a good Muslim is worse than a bad Christian.  But that is simply not true.  The people these racists will assume as Muslims may not be even Muslim as all, the gentleman who spotted Ahmad Rahami shares a similar skin complexion, but is a Sikh, whom share no connection with Muslims whatsoever.  Racial profiling is not only wrong but ineffective, since skin color doesn't define a person's religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you want to eat some Skittles, just remember they're just candy.  Mars Incorporated does the best it can to ensure the quality of their product.  It's entirely possible a stale Skittle makes it in the pile, but it isn't likely to happen.  That doesn't mean you should never eat Skittles again or throw out every bag of Skittles in your cabinet because one might make you sick in your stomach.  This wouldn't be acceptable with candy, and this is not the way Syrian refugees should be treated to, as they are human beings with far more complexities than your average piece of candy.  So while Donald Trump Jr. should probably stay away from Skittles as he will likely be paranoid that someone will give him poisoned candy over his stupid and ignorant comments, the rest of us can enjoy candy and know it's just that, candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Three Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week 3, unlike the week before, featured a lot of challenging match-ups, and for the first time ever, the Top 3 ranked teams in the AP poll play on the road against other ranked teams.  Alabama at Ole Miss, Florida State at Louisville and Ohio State at Oklahoma.  Safe to say, champions are made here.  Other plenty of entertaining games abound.  So what happened on Week 3?  Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/buffaloes.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Colorado Buffaloes&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Gotta love the Colorado Buffaloes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action started early on Saturday, with Lamar Jackson and Louisville hosting Florida State in a Top Ten match-up.  But by halftime, this game was anything but, as Louisville completely obliterated Florida State at home with a 63-20 romp.  Lamar Jackson proved to be the real deal, with five touchdowns (four rushing) against the Seminoles, as they made Florida State look just as bad as Charlotte and Syracuse.  Safe to say Lamar Jackson will now be the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy (with apologies to Christian McCaffrey).  Florida State made an impressive comeback against Ole Miss the first week but Louisville never stopped.  Very impressive.  The only thing I didn't like were their chrome helmets.  Aside from the butterfly on the back to honor hometown legend Muhammad Ali, I didn't like their helmets especially the white logo.  But at the end of the day, Florida State lost ugly, just like they did at the Rose Bowl against Marcus Mariota and the Oregon Ducks.  Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/bison.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;North Dakota State Bison&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;North Dakota State Bison quarter Easton Stick.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great match-up was Iowa vs. North Dakota State.  It's rare to call an FBS-FCS match-up exciting but as five time defending FCS champs, North Dakota State is not your typical FCS team.  It was certainly a big gamble for them to play at Top 15 team like Iowa, but North Dakota State played like a Big Ten team, pulling off the upset 23-21, with a field goal as time expired to win it.  North Dakota State played a bruising style of game, wearing Iowa out in the end, scoring the last nine points of the game.  North Dakota State became the first FCS team since Eastern Washington upset Oregon State in 2010 to beat a ranked FBS team.   Especially impressive against a team that made the Rose Bowl last year.  I'e always been impressed with the Bison from my time at Minnesota, and they could easily contend in the FBS if they wanted to.  They've won 6 straight against the FBS which says a lot, and they certainly aren't afraid of anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Appreciate it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WinTheDay&quot;&gt;@WinTheDay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✊ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SF27?src=hash&quot;&gt;#SF27&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/po22PweKtf&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/po22PweKtf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nebraska Football (@HuskerFBNation) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HuskerFBNation/status/777206703267786752&quot;&gt;September 17, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great match-up for Oregon as they faced Nebraska on the road in their first real test of the year, as well as Dakota Prukop's first challenge as FBS QB.  Before the game, Oregon laid some flowers at the 27 yard line in honor of their late punter Sam Foltz (who wore #27).  Very classy.  Way to go Oregon.  As for the game itself, it was a back and forth battle, but unfortunately, Nebraska won by 3.  Oregon had their chances, and their decision to go for 2 after each touchdown (they went 1-5 overall) was definitely puzzling to say the least, but you win some and lose some.  Oregon certainly plays bold as Mike Riley put it, but those types of missed opportunities along with a lot of penalties tilted the game in Nebraska's favor.  Dakota Prukop played well given the circumstances, but Royce Freeman got hurt on the first drive and didn't come back.  Despite the loss of Freeman, they didn't miss a beat with their running game.  Good game, but not the result Oregon wanted.  Up next, their conference opener against a much improved Colorado team.  Speaking of the Buffaloes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan played Colorado in a game that would've had no hype if not for the back and forth banter between the two schools.  Jim Harbaugh, hard-ass coach of Michigan with no sense of humor, refused to release his teams depth chart, believing in secrecy.  Colorado, in a humorous attempt to combat Michigan's lack of depth chart, released their own depth chart, with the likes of Elmer Fudd, Austin Powers and The Dude, which can only be described as hilarious and clever.  Possibly the funniest thing I've seen a team do, who cares if Jim Harbaugh found it unfunny.  In fact, their twitter feed as a whole was quite hilarious.  As for the game itself, Colorado played fairly well considering their recent past and playing Michigan at home.  They jumped out to a lead, but Michigan stormed back, winning 45-28.  They're not the joke they were when they entered the Pac-12, and Oregon shouldn't take them lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In case you haven&amp;#39;t seen this week&amp;#39;s depth chart.  What and who is in your favorite position? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoBuffs?src=hash&quot;&gt;#GoBuffs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/19qUmVyO6P&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/19qUmVyO6P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Colorado Football (@RunRalphieRun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RunRalphieRun/status/775718135315980288&quot;&gt;September 13, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn State did the inappropriate thing and honored Joe Paterno, fifty years after his first game, or forty years after he was first allegedly told that disgraced assistant Jerry Sandusky was molesting little boys.  Coaching aside, Joe Paterno did nothing and many suffered.  Some Penn State fans obsession with honoring Joe Paterno is absolutely sickening. --- Speaking of inappropriate, in last night's match-up between Rice and Baylor, the Rice marching band 'honored' Baylor's recent controversy by forming IX, a reference to Title IX.  Seems Rice is known for parody marches.  They certainly need something since Baylor easily won 38-10 ---  This week, Clemson was on the right side of a boneheaded play as South Carolina State kick returner Ahmaad Harris inexplicably handed the ball to a referee without taking a knee.  Clemson pounced on the ball to score a touchdown.  Clemson won the game 59-0 in a game that was shortened by six minutes as the two agreed to a mercy rule (to shorten said game) --- Alabama finally solved its Ole Miss problem, needing a 21-point comeback to win 48-43.  I hate Nick Saban.  I hate Lane Kiffin.  And now that Steve Sarkisian joined the staff, I hate him too.  --- Western Michigan got paid $210,000 to play Illinois and subsequently won 34-10.  They're 2-0 against the Big Ten this year, that's what I call highway robbery.  Double salute to the departed John Saunders.  --- USC is 1-2 for the first time since Pete Carroll's first year.  Another reason why USC is stupid and pathetic.  Every year it's the same story of what great talent they have all because they're USC.  And they never live up to the expectations and lose.  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson (-2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan State (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida State (-8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now as a bonus, in honor of Colorado's fake depth chart, here is my fake depth chart consisting of some of the pathetic people out there, for a team I call &quot;The Basket of Deplorables.&quot;  Starring who else but the Republican Presidential Candidate as starting Quarterback, his biggest ass kisser Chris Christie as fullback and handing the ball off to his favorite dictator in Vladimir Putin as running back, you'll be completed disgusted with this depth chart.  Thanks Colorado for the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row basket&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Most Pathetic Football Team Ever:&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;The Basket of Deplorables&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4&quot;&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Receiver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;6 Drake&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;9 Future&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Worst Politicians Currently in Office</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
    .row {
        border-bottom: none;

        padding-bottom: 0px;
    }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Let's be honest, politics is dumb at its core and politicians are terrible.  Currently, Congress has an approval rating of about 10% or so.  Plenty of our current politicians couldn't figure their way out of a paper bag, much less pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation.  No matter who's elected President, Congress will always find ways to screw things up and stop real progress from happening.  With that said, here are the 15 worst members of Congress, and as an added bonus, the 5 worst Governors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Worst Congressmen (and Congresswomen)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joe-wilson.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joe Wilson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Joe Wilson&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;15. Joe Wilson - South Carolina House of Representative - 2nd District&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rude and racist congressman who once yelled at Obama &quot;You lie!&quot; while Obama gave a speech on health care, Joe Wilson proved what a bozo he really is. Of course, Joe Wilson's racist approach to Obama was filled with hate and lies, as contrary to what Joe Wilson claimed, Obamacare does not provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants.  Democrats rebuked him, but Republicans protected him for something they'd complain about if a Democrat did the same thing to a Republican President.  Hypocrisy strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mike-lee.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Mike Lee&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mike Lee&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;14. Mike Lee - Utah Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you need to know about Mike Lee is that he's Ted Cruz's sidekick.  Plus he single handedly stopped a bill giving financial relief to Flint, Michigan by claiming &quot;They have plenty of money.&quot;  If there's anyone willing to follow Ted Cruz, it's Mike Lee.  Despite lacking major recognition, that alone gets Mike Lee on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mark-sanford.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Mark Sanford&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mark Sanford&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;13. Mark Sanford - South Carolina House of Representative - 1st District&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As former Governor, Sanford lied to his people by claiming he wanted to take a hike on the Appalachians, only to go legally missing for six days in 2009 before turning up in Argentina with his mistress.  Yet years later, after his time as Governor ended, South Carolinians in the first district forgave him by electing him back into political office.  Surely, they wouldn't feel the same way about Bill Clinton's affair…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lindsey-graham.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Lindsey Graham&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Lindsey Graham - South Carolina Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man John McCain once called his illegitimate son due to their military based similarities, Lindsey Graham is far less likeable and hasn't accomplished nearly as much as John McCain. If it were up to people like Graham and McCain, we'd spend all eternity in the Middle East fighting their wars, we don't have a clue of how to make things stable without our intervention.  It's no wonder Lindsey Graham couldn't even get 1% Republican support in the Presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/marco-rubio.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Marco Rubio&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Marco Rubio - Florida Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His values are decent but Marco Rubio is as untrustworthy and unreliable as they come.  He barely showed up to work as Senator, didn't want to run for re-election, but was pushed back in by external forces wanting to keep his seat and the Senate Majority Red.  His Presidential candidacy was predictable and uninspiring, going as far to insult Donald Trump's hand size.  Not the right message from someone who actually has Presidential material, but blew it acting like a child and ultimately lost his home state badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/steve-scalise.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Steve Scalise&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Steve Scalise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Steve Scalise - Louisiana House of Representative - 1st District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Scalise, one of the highest ranking members in Congress, once spoke to a white supremacist group looking for support, claiming he didn't know he was speaking to a white supremacist group founded by the infamous David Duke.  He should've known better than associating himself with David Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jim-jordan.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Jim Jordan&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Jim Jordan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Jim Jordan - Ohio House of Representative - 4th District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of two ultra conservative voices on the Benghazi committee, who didn't think their wasteful investigation into Hillary Clinton for the third time did enough to blame her, so he and fellow extremist Freedom Caucus member Mike Pompeo added to the Republican report nonsense blaming Hillary for something she didn't do.  Jim Jordan makes this list as the Chairman of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/rand-paul.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Rand Paul&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Rand Paul&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Rand Paul - Kentucky Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good old Aqua Buddha, the pretend Libertarian, who fights for privacy rights yet thinks the Government can force a woman to remain pregnant, Rand Paul is a fake Libertarian wannabe who once called Obama gay for supporting gay marriage (obviously a homophobic slur meaning 'stupid,' not a belief Obama is actually gay).  Rand Paul had such little confidence of winning the Presidential election that he forced Kentucky to change its rules to allow him to run for Senate as a backup plan.  He obviously didn't make it past Iowa, as not surprisingly, Rand Paul couldn't convince his Dad's followers to support him like they did Ron Paul since he's a phony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joni-ernst.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joni Ernst&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Joni Ernst&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Joni Ernst - Iowa Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joni Ernst, just elected Senator, scares the crap out of me.  Her looks, her actions and goofy smile makes her creepy.  Anyone who thinks Obama is a dictator but ignores Donald Trump's love for dictators and desire to be a dictator doesn't know what the word dictator means.  As someone who claims her experience castrating pigs would make her perfect for cutting &quot;pork&quot; (wasteful spending), I have no clue why the fair-minded people in Iowa voted for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/trey-gowdy.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Trey Gowdy&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Trey Gowdy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Trey Gowdy - South Carolina House of Representative - 4th District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current head of the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, also known as the Hillary Clinton Witch Hunt, Trey Gowdy, who looks like a ghost, accomplished nothing with the Republican witch hunt, wasting millions of dollars to find absolutely nothing new, creating a report all by themselves so the Democrats couldn't say anything nice.  Even worse, he awkwardly questioned Martin Shkreli for his purchase of the secret Wu-Tang Clan album which led to a bizarre back-and-forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jim-inhofe.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Jim Inhofe&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Jim Inhofe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Jim Inhofe - Oklahoma Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man whose brain must be made of snowballs, as Jim Inhofe, who infamously brought a snowball to a congressional meeting on climate change to make the claim that the existence of snow disproves climate change altogether.  Only an idiot like him would come to that conclusion, clearly there are 4 seasons throughout the year due to the Earth's axis tilt, and it's going to be summer somewhere on planet Earth.  Even worse, Inhofe claims religion as the sole reason it's a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/steve-king.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Steve King&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Steve King&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Steve King - Iowa House of Representative - 4th District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve King, King of the Anti-Hispanics claiming to be the King of Anti-Illegal Immigration, is a hateful scumbag who recently claimed that only white people have contributed to Western Society.  For someone like Steve King, immigrants aren't livestock but human beings, and treating them like animals is inhumane.  Steve King is the worst member of the House of Representatives, frequently making racist and homophobic remarks, as well as inflammatory remarks about President Obama, claiming he's a Muslim savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/tom-cotton.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Tom Cotton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Tom Cotton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Tom Cotton - Arkansas Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely in his first term as Senator, Tom Cotton, the youngest member in the Senate, led the way to trying to interfere with the Iran deal by sending a letter to the Supreme Leader of Iran with 46 other Republican senators telling Iran any deal made with Obama can be taken away and that he had no authority to make such a deal.  This type of action is illegal and should be criminal to interfere with a deal they aren't negotiating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mitch-mcconnell.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Mitch McConnell&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Mitch McConnell - Kentucky Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Majority leader who promised Republicans would accomplish more with control yet has accomplished nothing but play games and rewrite the rules.  For a man who once made it his mission to make Obama a one-term President, Mitch McConnell refuses to hold a vote on a replacement for Justice Scalia, inventing rules of 'the American people need to vote for a new justice' (not their choice) while blaming Obama for his actions (not accepting Justice Alito in 2006 is not the same as not holding a vote on Justice Alito in 2006).  A terrible Senate Leader, the Democrats need to take majority back.  Even worse, he takes credit for something he had no involvement in (a rising economy which Republicans have consistently fought against).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ted-cruz.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Ted Cruz&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Ted Cruz - Texas Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the worst Senator of modern times, rivaling the infamous Joseph McCarthy as the worst of all time, a selfish degenerate who only thinks of himself and would have no problem destroying the very fabric of this nation just to get his way, as shown with his Government shutdown.  It's very clear that Ted Cruz lives to oppose everything Obama has done, he even voted against a bill once Obama supported it.  This man is the most hateful person ever, believing everything should be about Christianity, trampling over everyone who's not Christian.  Ted Cruz is well disliked by both parties and after his speech at the RNC, will have the biggest target on his back in 2018 when he's up for reelection.  This man is a cancer and needs to go now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Worst Governors&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/chris-christie.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Chris Christie&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Chris Christie&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Chris Christie - New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Christie, the biggest opportunistic blowhard of them all, first doing the right thing by working with Obama for assistance with Hurricane Sandy, then complaining about Democrats after receiving negative comments from fellow Republicans, all to further his Presidential ambitions.  Chris Christie only cares about himself and will do anything, bashing Donald Trump during his own campaign but became Trump's biggest ass-kisser after he dropped out, desperate to be Vice President (which he didn't get). His mock trial of Hillary at the RNC was stupid and childish.  It's no wonder the people of New Jersey were so angry that they asked him to resign after endorsing Trump, in addition to their floundering economy.  And with the Bridgegate scandal hurting him despite his claims he knew nothing about it, chances are that's probably a lie based on his bullying ways.  Guilty of Not Guilty of being involved in Bridgegate?  Guilty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Rick Snyder - Michigan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, has led the city of Flint into a complete hell-hole thanks to his decision to change their water source for cost-cutting measures, all while refusing to spend a few extra bucks to treat lead-tainted water.  If that isn't bad enough, two years later, he has refused to do anything about it, ignoring the problem until the media started complaining.  He has refused to accept any responsibility for any of this, blaming Democrats for targeting him.  He even challenged himself to drink their lead-tainted water for 30 days straight, but never followed through, instead traveling overseas in an obvious attempt to appear reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Mike Pence - Indiana&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Governor of Indiana, an abortion hating religious freedom law passing homophobe, is the only person stupid enough to accept an offer to be Donald Trump's running mate.  He even made this following quote about Donald Trump: &quot;Not since Ronald Reagan in my lifetime has there been a man or woman at the national level who has heard the frustrations and the aspirations of the American people the way (Trump) does.&quot;   Despite this, he gave the worst endorsement in the history of endorsements to Ted Cruz, which helped lead to Ted Cruz's demise in his home state of Indiana, instead spending more time praising Donald Trump.  His handling of Indiana's religious freedom bill, which got scrapped, is a prime example of how stupid he truly is, unaware of what the word 'discrimination' means.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Sam Brownback - Kansas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Brownback presided over some of the most extreme tax cuts in history, costing Kansas millions of jobs and destroying their economy, in the name of Tea Party based experiments that have clearly failed.  Despite Kansas Republicans favoring a moderate Democrat to defeat him in the last election, the voters of Kansas re-elected this economy wrecking bozo.  Turns out the great experiment has been a complete catastrophe to everyone except for Brownback himself.  He also removed gay rights in the public sector, claiming it would help military veterans somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Pat McCrory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Pat McCrory - North Carolina&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat McCrory is a lunatic who thinks bathroom use is the most important thing needing to be fixed in North Carolina, as he has waged war against all the LGBT, believing no city in his state can give them the human rights they deserve while claiming transgenders don't exist, don't have any rights, and are likely to be sexual predators targeting women in bathrooms. If that's not bad enough, he blames it on Charlotte for giving the LGBT the rights they deserve.  He doesn't care how much money he's costing the state, especially after the NBA yanked the All-Star game from Charlotte, instead continuing his war in the bathroom.  Instead, he's willing to sue the Government for protecting basic human rights.  It's not common sense, it's discriminatory.  Pat McCrory, who clearly is using this war to get Republican support during an Election year, needs to be voted out.  The state of North Carolina deserves better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Two Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On paper, Week Two looked to be the worst weekend of college football ever.  No ranked teams facing each other, more ranked teams playing FCS weaklings than fellow Power 5 teams, and just one ranked team on the road, #13 Louisville playing at Syracuse in an ACC Showdown.  But life has plenty of surprises, as Week 2 provided more entertainment than on paper.  Week 3 promises to be better in terms of quality matchups, but here are my thoughts on what happened in Week 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lamar-jackson.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Lamar Jackson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Lamar Jackson makes it look easy hurdling over a Syracuse defender.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, Louisville had the toughest game scheduled for a ranked team, by virtue of being on the road against Syracuse.  Although Louisville's first two opponents, Marshall and Syracuse, don't exactly bring fear in anyone's eyes, sophomore Quarterback Lamar Jackson has put on quite the show, with 7 passing touchdowns and 6 rushing touchdowns in just two games.  He had 411 passing yards along with 199 rushing yards against Syracuse, putting on a dazzling performance and could very well join the Heisman conversation.  Next week, they play Florida State at home, which would be huge for Lamar Jackson.  A win and great offense production would likely shoot him up to the top of the Heisman conversation.  Louisville also plays Clemson and Houston.  It's too early to but into the hype on Lamar Jackson, but as a sophomore, he's definitely worthy of the talk right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minnesota had a gimme game against FCS Indiana State, and easily won 58-28, which was Minnesota's highest scoring game since 2006 when they dropped 63 against Indiana.  Hard to believe it's been ten years since I was a student at the University of Minnesota; I was at that game.  Time has certainly flown since then.  Not much to say about playing an FCS team, but since Minnesota has struggled against them in years past, a blowout is great to hear.  Speaking of FCS teams, four time defending FCS champion North Dakota State plays next week at Iowa.  That should be an interesting game.  As for Minnesota, they have a bye next week before playing Colorado State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oregon played Virginia, who became the first ACC team to set foot in Autzen Stadium.  Virginia is not that good of a football team, but played as well as they could, but Oregon easily won, 44-26.  The offense looked more in sync than last week, as Royce Freeman went wild, rushing for 207 yds, while Dakota Prukop had three touchdowns to three different receivers, including Pharaoh Brown (his first since 2014) and Devon Allen (back from Rio, complete with a hurdle celebration).  Still, their defense has plenty of questions as they gave up quite a few big rushing gains.  Thankfully, the yellow jerseys look a lot better than last week's gray jerseys.  That's a plus.  Up next week, a trip to Nebraska, where of course, they will face former nemesis Mike Riley in a different uniform.  A far more challenging test than Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/fumble.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Fumble&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Ray-Ray McCloud (left) and Kaelin Clay from two seasons ago (right) dropping the ball just before reaching the end zone.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clemson might be #2 in the polls, but didn't play like one against Troy.  Even worse, punt returner Ray-Ray McCloud managed to pull a Kaelin Clay by dropping the ball just short of the end zone.  Thankfully for the Tigers, Troy didn't catch onto this and return it for a touchdown like Oregon did against Utah in that infamous play two years ago. But a 30-24 victory isn't satisfying against Troy. --- Central Michigan completed the best play of the season so far with an incredible Hail Mary and lateral to upset #22 Oklahoma State.  Oklahoma State always manages to wind up on the wrong side of great stories, at least that's the way it seems to me.  Of course, an admitted official error gave the Chippewas of Central Michigan a chance but OK State has no one to blame but themselves for a poor defensive performance.  ---  USC LT Chuma Edoga shoved a ref and got thrown out.  Did he seriously think that wasn't going to happen?  Only at USC, right? --- Northwestern lost again, this time to FCS Illinois State.  Yikes!  --- Pittsburgh Running Back James Conner, back this year after battling Hodgkin's Lymphoma, has played well in his comeback so far.  I'm not sure whose comeback is greater, his or Pharaoh Brown's.  Both are winners in my books.  Congrats to James Conner.  -- Thrilling game between TCU and Arkansas, as TCU came back from a 20-7 deficit to take a 28-20 lead only for Arkansas to get a touchdown in the last minute and a double reverse pass for the two-point conversion, only for KaVontae Turpin (tine) to get a great kickoff return to put TCU in field goal range, which even crazier, got blocked.  Arkansas won 41-38 in Double OT-- Virginia Tech played Tennessee at the Bristol Motor Speedway, setting an FBS record with an attendance of 156,990.  That's a lot of people, I never knew NASCAR had stadiums that held that many people, crazy!  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/central-michigan.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Central Michigan&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Central Michigan stunned Oklahoma State with the Hail-and-Lateral play.  Wow!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida State (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Nature Deserves Respect Too</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On August 29th, a group of idiots, believing they can do whatever they want without any repercussions, destroyed a famous rock at Cape Kiwanda known as Duckbill.  Fortunately, someone recorded them committing the act and confronted them over it.  But the damage was done, all because some idiots couldn’t read a sign and blamed everyone but themselves for something that was obviously avoidable.  Too many people take nature for granted, and it deserves every bit of respect it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/kiwanda.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Cape Kiwanda&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Cape Kiwanda&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been to Cape Kiwanda a few times and it is to me, one of the most beautiful areas along the Oregon Coast.  But I also know the risks of being close to the edge and I will respect signs that say 'Do Not Enter.'  For this reason, I never saw or heard of the Duckbill before it was destroyed, but it looked pretty, just like the whole area.  I admit, I have crossed signs I was told not to, but I always take the highest precautions and never stray too far from the trail, usually not more than a few steps beyond the path.  Safety is important.  Unfortunately, these Idiots crossed the Do Not Enter sign, and even worse, took it upon themselves to destroy a popular spot, for incredibly stupid reasons.  These idiots excuse?  They were doing the world a favor by preventing anyone else from getting hurt because one of these idiots broke his leg standing on top the Duckbill.  It was not for them to take matters for themselves, especially when they shouldn’t have been there in the first place.  That is a complete disregard for nature and selfishness on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Oregon, it’s not surprising that people like me love nature and cherish it for its beauty and mystique.  And not surprisingly, I have seen many stories of idiots not giving a damn about nature.  Last year, some dweebs etched their names in a railing at Tumalo Falls, and felt entitled to do so after being confronted by someone who took a picture of them showcasing their 'art.'  It’s reasons like this that make me disgusted with entitled pricks, and more reasons to appreciate nature for what it is.  Nature is alive and energetic, just like humans, animals and plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/duckbill.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Duckbill&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;If the idiots who destroyed Duckbill want to do the world a favor, they should turn themselves in and face punishment&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things to love about nature, yet others would love to destroy it for profit.  Just like the pathetic Bundy clan and their anti-government militiamen.  If it were up to them, they would completely destroy nature just so they could make money.  That’s what their stupid mantra is all about.  They can claim the government has no right to land ownership, but some land is worth cherishing for its beauty.  Can you imagine if the Grand Canyon was owned by corporations and built all the properties they could?  That would completely devalue the natural beauty the Grand Canyon has to offer.  It's the same with those who pollute the Earth and all the land they are near in the name of profit.  I’ve never been to Glacier National Park, but reading its history and seeing the pictures, one can clearly see how global warming has damaged the very fabric the park has to offer, its Glaciers.  I would love to go there before they’re completely melted away by outside interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you don't truly appreciate something until it's gone.  This is no exception with nature.  Humans aren't necessarily the root of all the destroying of nature, some of it is natural.  The famous Old Man of the Mountain, which was arguably one of New Hampshire's most famous attractions, collapsed in 2003 to much disappointment, but it 'died' of natural causes.  With events like this, you never really know how long nature will last.  It certainly doesn't help when humans take it for granted and outright trash and destroy parts of it.  Earlier this year, a group of frat boy punks had too much fun on Lake Shasta and when they were done, completely disregarded it, leaving all their trash there, acting as if nature is nothing more than a toilet.  But it's not, because believe it or not, some people actually value nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/kiwanda2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Cape Kiwanda&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Another great picture of Cape Kiwanda.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be the first person to admit I haven't been completely perfect with nature.  As a young'un, I thought it would be cool to take a piece of lava from Lava Butte, and when I was older, a little piece of the Painted Hills, but in retrospect, was it really worth it?  Not really.  It seemed like good sentimental value, but it doesn't beat the memories itself, the pictures I've taken and seen, nor the experience itself.  Some dweebs take things for granted, do stupid things and feel as if it's not worth protecting, that somehow, it's an inconvenience when you get hurt from the more perilous parts of nature.  In the end, when humans do stupid things, they'll blame everyone but themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>NFL Preview</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As further proof of the seasons changing, the NFL season is about to start, with a Thursday night rematch of Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos vs. the Carolina Panthers.  It should be an exciting year in the NFL, with a lot of notable events in the offseason and plenty of more on the way.  Which team will surprise this year?  Which team will disappoint this year?  Who wins the MVP?  Here's my thoughts on the NFL season on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/adrian-peterson.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Adrian Peterson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Adrian Peterson is a BEAST!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I was really looking forward to this season, the Minnesota Vikings were primed to make an explosion with their new stadium, US Bank Stadium up and running.  Teddy Bridgewater looked great and ready to take the next step.  Unfortunately, he tore his ACL and dislocated his knee in practice, ending his year before it started.  That left the Vikings in shock and disbelief, but with the perfect coach in Mike Zimmer, who should have been hired as a coach years ago but the Vikings aren't going to complain about that one, still have the talent to at least make the playoffs, led by Adrian Peterson (still as strong as ever) and an elite defense.  Clearly, the Vikings are going for a moon shot this year, which is why they acquired Sam Bradford from Philadelphia to replace Teddy Bridgewater this year.  A HUGE gamble to say the least, as Sam Bradford is talented, but has little time to learn the offense.  For his sake, he's in a better place than his previous stops, but only time will tell if the gamble pays off or not.  As for the rest of the NFC North, the Detroit Lions will be a different team with Calvin Johnson retiring, as we will once and for all see if Matthew Stafford is a capable quarterback or just the product of Calvin Johnson's freakish skills.  Chicago will remain mediocre, there's no reason to believe Jay Cutler will be any better or worse than before.  The Green Bay Packers, as long as they have Aaron Rodgers at Quarterback, will remain Super Bowl contenders.  My pick to win the NFC North: Green Bay.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Their first opponent of the season is another team I've got my eye on, the Tennessee Titans, led by Marcus Mariota.  Mariota started his career with a perfect passer rating, but the Titans lacked the right weapons or coaching staff, as the Titans finished with a league worst 2-14 record.  Mike Mularkey is now the Head Coach, an interim for the failed Ken Whisenhunt.  Tennessee now has some better offensive weapons, with DeMarco Murray and last year's Heisman winner Derrick Henry joining the team as a dynamic Running Back duo.  There's no question Mariota has the talent and drive to succeed, but with Tennessee still young, how much will they improve?  Just remember, Peyton Manning had a 3-13 record in his rookie year.  Of course, the AFC South is up for grabs.  Indianapolis gave Andrew Luck a big extension, yet there are plenty of questions of surrounding players.  Houston still has a great defense led by J.J. Watt, a talented wide receiver in DeAndre Hopkins, but questions still remain at the Quarterback position, although Brock Osweiler appears to be an upgrade from the Brian Hoyer/Ryan Mallett combo from last year.  Jacksonville hasn't done much to improve their roster, and the jury's still out on Blake Bortles.  My pick to win the AFC South: Indianapolis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/marcus-mariota.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Marcus Mariota&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Will Marcus Mariota lead Tennessee to success this year?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;The New England Patriots are as loaded as ever, but Tom Brady finally got his suspension from Deflate-gate completed, so Brady will have to miss the first four games of this season.  Can Jimmy Garoppolo succeed while Brady's on mandatory vacation?  As long as Rob Gronkowski's around, I imagine the Patriots will be just fine.  The rest of the division is mediocre.  The New York Jets have a nice defense, but Ryan Fitzpatrick held out most of training camp and although he played well last year, I can't completely get behind him.  Buffalo has loudmouth schnook Rex Ryan as coach, which has improved their defense, but Tyrod Taylor is still an unknown as a Quarterback.  Miami is a confusing team, and Ryan Tannehill is the most unpredictable quarterback in the NFL, why Miami gave him a big contract is beyond me.  My pick to win the AFC East: New England.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;Chip Kelly, fired from the Philadelphia Eagles, takes his talents west to the San Francisco 49ers, who have been in the news a lot recently for Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the National Anthem.  Though Kaepernick is now the teams backup quarterback, behind Blaine Gabbert (of all people), Chip will get another shot of perfecting his style of play in the NFL.  Kaepernick seemed like a good fit, but hasn't been playing as well (or has been all that healthy) to be the starter.  Thankfully, Chip Kelly won't be GM for the 49ers, because that's what cost him his job with the Eagles.  Too many questions about the 49ers roster and playing in a tough division won't help.  The NFL returns to Los Angeles as the Rams left St. Louis to come back to LA.  They still have questions about their Quarterback as top pick Jared Goff hasn't looked that well so far and was named third string at the moment behind Case Keenum and Sean Mannion (who would've thought that).  Same division as the 49ers, but lots of pressure on coach Jeff Fisher, who's obviously talented but hasn't gotten the Rams where they need to be.  Hopefully, they will get the continued production from running back Todd Gurley, who looks like a future star.  Seattle is still as talented as ever, with their stout defense, but they have lost key players since their Super Bowl win a few years ago, and Marshawn Lynch retired.  The Arizona Cardinals are still talented, and Bruce Arians is one of the best coaches in the NFL.  But who knows whether Carson Palmer can continue being the great quarterback he is.  My pick to win the NFC West: Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
    		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/andrew-luck.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Andrew Luck&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
    		&lt;h4&gt;Andrew Luck needs a big year...my Mom's counting on it!&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;No team will be more puzzling to figure out than the Super Bowl Champions, the Denver Broncos.  On the on hand, their defense as a great as ever, led by Von Miller at Linebacker, whose suffocating play carried them to the Super Bowl victory over the high powered Carolina Panthers.  On the other hand, Peyton Manning retired and their quarterback replacement wound up in an unexpected way.  Brock Osweiler left for Houston, Mark Sanchez was acquired but didn't do much (ultimately, he was cut), Paxton Lynch was drafted as the future QB, but it was third string Quarterback Trevor Siemian who was named the starter after an impressive preseason.  Siemian played just one snap his rookie season, a kneel down at the end of a game, now in his second season, becomes the first Quarterback to start for a Super Bowl Champion without a single pass attempt in the NFL.  Should be very interesting to see how well they perform.  Kansas City has plenty of talent, and Alex Smith has slowly become one of the most reliable quarterbacks in the NFL.  The 49ers should have kept him over Kaepernick, but who could blame them at the time.  The Raiders, perhaps in their last year in Oakland, have suddenly shown some signs of respectability, with Derek Carr having great potential as a star Quarterback.  Their defense has improved, led by Khalil Mack, who's a complete stud.  The big question is whether the Raiders can play consistently in what might be their last year in Oakland.  One thing's for sure, the NFL would never be the same if they do in fact move to Las Vegas.  San Diego looks like a complete mess, totally wasting Philip Rivers potential as their Quarterback.  Never a good sign when rookie Joey Bosa just signed a deal after a long and pointless holdout.  My pick to win the AFC West: Kansas City.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;The AFC North, like always, will run through Pittsburgh, despite the suspension from running back LeVeon Bell.  Their defense is still good, and Ben Roethlisberger is still elite.  Baltimore had a down year last season, but with Joe Flacco still around, Baltimore will have a better year this season, but still looks mediocre at best.  Cincinnati looked like it was about to take the next step last year, and Andy Dalton certainly took the next step, but their defense is still completely undisciplined.  Plus with Hue Jackson now head coach of the Cleveland Browns, their offense could take a dive.  One thing remains for sure, the Cleveland Browns are still a terrible team.  Robert Griffin III, a.k.a. RGIII is desperate to revive his career, and he definitely needed to leave Washington, but Cleveland is still quarterback purgatory.  My feeling is that RGIII is damaged goods, and it's unfortunate, because I was pretty high on him entering the NFL.  My pick to win the AFC North: Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
 		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/von-miller.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Von Miller&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
 		&lt;h4&gt;No defensive player will be more crucial this year than Von Miller&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;   
    &lt;p&gt;Carolina remains the best team in the NFC South, but the potential for a post-Super Bowl hangover could derail their hopes.  But with Cam Newton still extremely talented and most of their core back, they're still dangerous.  The Atlanta Falcons have Matt Ryan leading the way, and Julio Jones is still a talented Wide Receiver, but I'm not sure they'll be anything more than .500 team.  Tampa Bay has potential to improve this year, with Jameis Winston showing some potential, but they fired Lovie Smith as head coach and replaced him with Dirk Koetter, a puzzling move to say the least.  Meanwhile, the New Orleans Saints still have defensive flaws and will need to lean on Drew Brees once again to provide their offense.  My pick to win the NFC South: Carolina&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p&gt;The NFC East will still be up for grabs this year.  Washington was the best team last year, but they benefited from a weak division.  They were exposed in the playoffs.  I still have my doubts on Kirk Cousins.  Dallas will remain in limbo as long as quarterback Tony Romo remains hurt.  Who knows when he will come back.  Of course, Ezekiel Elliott and Dak Prescott could very well be the new dynamic duo.  They still need Romo's leadership.  The New York Giants have a new coach, with Tom Coughlin retiring, and as long as Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. remain on the roster, the Giants can win some games, especially in a weak division.  Philadelphia looks like a complete mess, it's as if they completely wiped out the core of Chip Kelly's roster moves last year.  Now that Sam Bradford was traded, it's up to rookie Carson Wentz to lead what's left over for that offense.  My pick to win the NFC East: The New York Giants.&lt;/p&gt;
  
 &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
 		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/us-bank-stadium.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;US Bank Stadium&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
 		&lt;h4&gt;The Vikings new stadium: US Bank Stadium.  All I can say is Wow!&lt;/h4&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;       
    &lt;p&gt;The AFC has plenty of strong teams like last year, and it will remain tough this year.  New England, Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Indianapolis will make the playoffs winning their divisions, with Denver and the New York Jets getting in as wild cards.  The NFC will also have some strong teams, but won't be as strong as the AFC.  Seattle, Green Bay, Carolina and New York Giants will make the playoffs winning their divisions, with Minnesota and Arizona making the wild cards.  My prediction for the Super Bowl is New England vs. Green Bay, with the Patriots winning it all.  As usual, they're the most complete team, even with Brady out four games, it won't affect their Super Bowl or playoff dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week One Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thank god football's back.  It's refreshing to take interest in something besides politics and this ridiculous election.  Week One is under wraps, and though only a handful of games carry any value, it's only the beginning.  Here's my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/taiyon-devers.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Tai'yon Devers&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Tai'yon Devers with two sacks, both fumbles recovered by the Gophers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gophers played a tough game against Oregon State, managing to hold onto a 30-23 win despite some sluggishness in the passing game and three ejections from targeting.  Rodney Smith did a good job running and Mitch Leidner showcased his gutsy running on key downs.  Oregon State looked decent and are heading in the right direction, but still a young team, and it showed.  The first game of the season, obviously, but the Gophers will need to play better to take the next step.  Either way, the Gophers won the battle of the 'Rodents,' the only two Major FBS teams with rodent mascots.  Next up, FCS Indiana State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also playing Thursday night was my pick as most overrated team in the Top 10, Tennessee, who went above and beyond to prove their overrated-ness, just barely beating Appalachian State in OT, 20-13, exactly nine years to the day that the Mountaineers of Appalachian State pulled off their historic massive upset of Michigan.  Safe to say, Tennessee is not there quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, my pick for most underrated team, Houston, played against Oklahoma in a battle of Top 15 teams.  The biggest game in Houston’s history, the Cougars surprised virtually everyone outside Houston by beating Oklahoma.  I'd figured Houston would play well, but exceeded expectations.  The game turned when Houston Auburned Oklahoma with a end-zone to end-zone missed field goal into a touchdown, reminiscent of Auburn’s famous play three years ago against Alabama.  Houston blew the game open after that.  Very impressive effort by Houston, whose Peach Bowl win against Florida State is a game of the past according to the team.  Great philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/royce-freeman.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Royce Freeman&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Royce Freeman was his usual self.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oregon Ducks began their season against UC Davis, and of course, Oregon won 53-28.  Nothing too spectacular to say, except it was nice to see Pharaoh Brown back after his horrific injury.  Dakota Prukop played as well as one would expect against an FCS team.  On the flip side, their jerseys weren't that great to me, not sure why their jerseys are gray for this game, but they go through so many combos we’ll probably never see it again.  And for the first time in 17 years, Autzen Stadium did not sell out their seats.  Next up, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the rest of the games, here are my thoughts.  Once again, USC proved how consistently overrated they are, as defending champs Alabama completely rolled over them 52-6.  Never expected the lousy Trojans to win this game, but a good team would've kept it close.  USC on the other hand, just plain sucked. --- Navy had to pull a quarterback out of the stands to fill in after starter Tago Smith got injured.  Enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame, backup from the stands Malcolm Perry.  Georgia Tech barely beat Boston College in a game played in Dublin, Ireland.  If only Notre Dame had played against Georgia Tech, it would've been the perfect Irish matchup.  But please, no car bombs. --- Virginia, whom Oregon plays next week, lost to FCS power Richmond 37-20.  So much for having two legit Power 5 non-conference teams on the schedule.  At least there's Nebraska. --- Speaking of Nebraska, it was very sweet for them to bring out ten players during their first punt to honor Sam Foltz, who died in a car wreck in July.  Classy act.  Not classy was the scumbag who robbed his brother’s house while this was happening.  This scumbag, who was arrested today, but not identified as of yet, should become the most hated person in Nebraska. --- Northwestern lost to Western Michigan 22-21, which makes me wonder if the recently departed journalist John Saunders (R.I.P.), who went to Western Michigan, lifted them spiritually.  John Saunders was one of my favorites, he will be missed. --- Washington State again proved how unpredictable they are by losing to Eastern Washington 45-42.  They looked fairly good last year despite a loss to Portland State.  They follow up this year with a loss to another FCS team.  What in the hell is Mike Leach smoking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/houston.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Houston&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Houston turned the game in their favorite with this missed field goal returned for a touchdown.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week One doesn’t say a lot about the National Championship, but it’s safe to say that Oklahoma won’t win it like I predicted.  By no means does this mean they won’t make it to the playoffs, they can still win out the rest of their games and win the Big XII, but their defense isn’t as great as I thought.  I need to do some better research next time.  Of course, Houston, with its marquee win, has a chance to run the table and make the Playoffs itself.  They still have Louisville to play late in the regular season as a good non-conference game, but they have the talent to go undefeated in the American Athletic Conference and crash the Power 5 Playoff Party.  With that, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LSU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
