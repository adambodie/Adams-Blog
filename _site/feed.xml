        <title>RNC vs. DNC - Two Different Worlds</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Republican and Democrat National Conventions have come and gone, officially ending the Primaries.  Seeing bits of each, I can safely say one thing: the two Parties are from two different worlds. One filled with anger and hate, the other filled with love and passion.  So which one better reflects us as a nation?  Here are my thoughts on each convention and my allegiance going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/obama-clinton.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Obama and Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RNC, not surprisingly, was a complete mess, full of hatred and spew.  There were no legitimate complaints about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, just lies, lies and more lies.  Clearly, the Republicans are full of anger.  For example, Hillary Clinton does not want to get rid of the Second Amendment, yet this was repeated multiple times.  Many of the speakers criticisms were emotionally charged falsehoods that attack their opponents personally without any evidence to back up their claims.  It&#39;s been proven for years that Obama has never been a Muslim yet the Right refuses to accept that he is a Christian, claiming he must be a Muslim because of his worldview being so different from theirs.  No matter how hard they try, it will never be true.  That is called RACISM. And Hillary’s emails? Just another distraction from the real issues facing our country and the Republicans lack of substantial ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main speakers tried to paint Donald Trump in a positive viewpoint; mainly his family, but this is a very limited piece of Donald Trump.  He wants to run this country like his business, not like he treats his family.  His business record speaks for itself.  Bankruptcies, lawsuits, not paying workers and fraud.  And not surprisingly, his family doesn&#39;t see this or chooses not to accept this. Melania Trump’s speech was a ripoff of Michelle Obama’s speech at the 2008 DNC; clearly not that smart.  Republicans like Newt Gingrich claim it&#39;s not a big deal she plagiarized someone else&#39;s speech, but surely he&#39;d cry foul if Hillary Clinton did the same thing. Duh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/christie.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Chris Christie&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Chris Christie: Guilty or not guilty of hugging Hillary Clinton?  GUILTY!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some low points include Chris Christie&#39;s mock trial for Hillary Clinton.  Chances are, they wouldn&#39;t complain about Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice doing the exact same thing as Hillary Clinton did with her stupid emails.  It was stupid, not criminal, but Republican&#39;s merely WANTED her to be indicted.  They don&#39;t care about the truth.  Coming from an opportunistic ass wipe who rightfully complained about Donald Trump, then starting kissing his feet the moment he dropped out of the Presidential race.  Another low point was Ted Cruz refusing to endorse Donald Trump, leading to boos and anger from a divided crowd.  I don&#39;t blame Cruz (for once), after all, Trump made trash TV comments about his family.  It says a lot about the Republicans in general.  With that said, I passionately hate Ted Cruz and will love to see the end of his Political career, hopefully sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which leads us to Donald Trump himself.  After his speech, it&#39;s hard to believe he even likes America.  I certainly felt like I wasted my time listening to his ridiculous angry dribble.  He spent his time criticizing everything about us, believing the world is on fire, life is in shambles, and everything is on the verge of collapse.  Not surprisingly, the only thing Donald Trump talked good about was wait for it...HIMSELF.  He believes he&#39;s the only one who can fix things, pumps himself up as a Messiah, all while blaming everything on the Democrats.  But Trump has no ideas on how to fix anything.  No plan to defeat ISIS, no plan to help the Economy, Nothing.  His campaign is a joke full of catchphrases, extreme hyperboles, empty promises worth less than a degree from Trump University, hateful rhetoric towards everyone not like him, and all for personal gain. Trump’s vision of this country is blatantly false, dreary and downright scary, and he can&#39;t be trusted to fix anything, let alone fix things ‘quickly’.  I certainly don&#39;t leave my house everyday wondering if a Terrorist is going to attack me.  I don&#39;t have any reason to believe everything wrong with my life is due to Foreigners.  I certainly don&#39;t believe a man so secretive can be trusted with doing the dishes, let alone lead our country.  All the nice things said about him really can&#39;t be proven, because his public persona is that of an egotistical misogynistic asshole.  I didn&#39;t watch the RNC live, I was up thankfully out of town.  I did not miss a thing.  A few stupid clips I saw were downright pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/clinton-kaine.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine: Real Leaders&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNC was not surprisingly, more kind and accepting towards all people.  They showed appreciation for both the Police and African Americans.  The RNC only likes the Police, vilifying African Americans, particularly Black Lives Matter, as the problem; mere Police Killers. NOT TRUE! Their complaints about Donald Trump were based primarily on his own words, not made up rhetoric based on fiction and selfish desires.  Nope, speaker after speaker referred to Trump&#39;s words to critique his plans based on his own words.  After all, he said what he meant, and he meant what he said.  Trump owns his words and ridiculous rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main speakers were ALL supportive of Hillary and described her compassion to fight for progress.  Michelle Obama gracefully attacked Trump as bad for children, using her own thoughts while showcasing her passion for the country she loves.  Bernie Sanders declared Hillary as the only candidate to vote for despite their minor disagreements.  Bill Clinton used his folkish charm to describe his passion for Hillary and Obama strongly rebuked Donald Trump’s version of America as bogus.  Attack after attack on Donald Trump’s twisted world of hate and fear.  That’s the way to do it.  We also can&#39;t forget Joe Biden’s attack on Trump’s malarkey and Tim Kaine’s fatherly mocking of Donald Trump’s phrase: Believe Me.  Believe Trump? Not even in Bizarro World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNC covered all factions of potential voters, even the Anti-Trump Republican&#39;s who know he’s plagued their Party for years to come.  Speakers like Independent Michael Bloomberg and Retired General John Hutson proclaimed that while Hillary isn&#39;t perfect (no one is perfect), she’s the only one remotely qualified for the job.  They reached out to Bernie Sanders biggest fans time and time again, and gave everyone an equal opportunity to represent their views.  None of that at the RNC.  It was all the same viewpoint they shared of doom and gloom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/crying-baby.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Crying Baby&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I would cry too, poor kid.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love America, and I&#39;m a proud American. That&#39;s why Hillary Clinton’s speech was the obviously better of the two.  It doesn&#39;t matter what anyone thinks of her.  She loves this country and will fight to make things better.  I can&#39;t say the same about Donald Trump.  He hates this country and thinks everyone a part of it is weak, stupid or detrimental to our society.  He puts himself above all, while Hillary will keep fighting for others.  This is why Republicans hate her so much; her fiery passion is detrimental to their way and her relentlessness is unmatched.  Truth be told, she has more balls than most men, especially easily offended Donald Trump.  No dwelling, just passion to do things the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional gridlock is our biggest problem right now, and only one candidate even sees it as a problem to fix: Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump thinks he can spit in all of Congress’s faces and do whatever he wants.  That&#39;s how he has lived his entire life.  Hillary Clinton is willing to work together to get things done.  Working with allies is a solution.  Donald Trump sees this as a problem, alienating everyone of our allies while praising dictators around the world as good leaders.  Obviously a crystal ball into Donald Trump’s leadership skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is only right about one thing: We need change.  But we need good change, not bad change.  Good changes defeat terrorists with our allies, strengthens the economy bottom-up and prospers as one.  Trump’s change leads to economic crises, constant attacks from Terrorists using his own words as encouragement and a deeply divided country from which only he benefits from.  Donald Trump is a historically horrific candidate; anyone who actually believes one word out of his mouth is downright stupid.  That’s why the Election is that important and clear who must lead our country to survive. That&#39;s why I&#39;m voting Hillary Rodham Clinton for President.  Thank you and good night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Donald Trump, Vice President of Russia?</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Last week, just before the Democratic National Convention started, hackers released emails from the DNC pertaining to their head’s plans to push candidate Bernie Sanders out of the race.  The hacks were deemed by U.S. officials as likely the work of the Russians, perhaps in an attempt to sway the election towards Republican Donald Trump.  Now, Donald Trump himself has asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them.  Clearly, Donald Trump prefers Russia over Democrats in the United States.  A man who has repeatedly praised Russia President Vladimir Putin as a great leader and capable of ‘getting stuff done,’ one question remains.  Is Donald Trump working to become President of the United States or the Vice President of Russia?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-kiss.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump Vladimir Putin Kiss&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;An Iconic painting of Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump kissing in Lithuania.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, Russia, the Soviet Union, whatever they have been called, have been our rivals.  From World War II to the Cold War, relations between us and the Soviet Russians have been frosty at best.  Even after the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union, Russia plays by its own rules and wants world power.  To have American pride, you must be proud of America and all of it, and not say great things about our so-called geo-political foes.  Donald Trump has repeatedly violated this by praising their President while saying nothing but awful things about our President.  If Donald Trump truly hates Obama, he needs to move to Russia where he can shower praise for their President.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Vladimir Putin is a bully and a tyrant, a man incapable of caring about anyone else and will use anyone that likes him as his play toy.  He is one of the few leaders in the world with less of a soul than Donald Trump.  So it’s not surprising that Donald Trump is kissing his ass.  Trump only cares about power, like Putin does.  It’s no surprise Putin would prefer him over Hillary Clinton.  While Clinton has and will stand up to Putin’s tyrannical ways, Trump will be taken along for a ride until the United States is sold to the Russians.  Trump would probably make billions.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The fact that Trump would ask the Russians to help him is a clear sign that he’s working with the Russians, whether directly or indirectly, to win the Presidency here, but he’s too naive and stupid to realize that Russia wants us trampled, perhaps the better term would be ‘trumpled.’  Russia has been accused of killing rivals, trampling on human rights and other criminal activities, and while Trump believes every denial from Putin’s mouth, clearly they have similarities, as Trump defrauds, lies and hides everything there is to know about him.  Perhaps Donald Trump’s tax returns would show his true appreciation for Russia and his partnership he wishes to have with them.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We need a President who puts America First.  Donald Trump claims he’s the only one who puts America first, but his actions have made it clear he’s putting Russia First.  He complains about Hillary and her emails but essentially praises the Russians for breaking the law and encourages them to break the law.  We need someone that will protect us and stand up for us, not a criminal.  This is not the man we need as President of the United States.  If Trump wants to be the Vice President of Russia, please vote Hillary Clinton for President and force him to move there.  He doesn’t belong here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Pokemon Whoa!</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;

    text-indent: 2em;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/no-pokemon.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;No Pokemon&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Do the right thing...say No to Pokemon Go&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For the past two weeks, I&#39;ve heard the most bizarre stories, all relating to the new super-viral video game that has seemingly taken over the world, Pokemon Go.  Pokemon first hit the scene 20 years ago, but this game allows people to try to &#39;catch-em all&#39; based on real-world locations, getting people out and about just to catch Pokemon on their game.  It&#39;s led to some bizarre stories; people catching criminals, getting stabbed by others, finding dead bodies, guns, etc., getting in car accidents, taking up police parking, fire parking, and other bizarre warnings all over Pokemon Go.  I played the original Pokemon games when I was a teenager, but now we&#39;re seeing adults playing the game; it&#39;s pure madness, all these ridiculous real-life events happening based solely on this game.  Imagine what else this game can lead to.  Here&#39;s a list of five things I wish this game could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/db-cooper.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;D.B. Cooper&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Who&#39;s D.B. Cooper?  Maybe Pokemon can find him.&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;D.B. Cooper: The FBI just a few days ago officially stopped investigating the infamous D.B. Cooper case, a man who in 1971 hijacked a plane flying from Portland to Seattle, jumping out of the plane with $200,000 ransom.  No one has ever found him or any evidence he even survived the jump, but in 1980, an eight-year old boy found some of the ransom money washed up somewhere in southwest Washington near the town of Amboy.  Wouldn&#39;t it only be perfect for someone playing the game nearby to find additional money hidden in the ground, or perhaps, a body for the legendary D.B. Cooper.  Maybe some other additional evidence. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; Missing children: Children are our future, and anyone who would want to hurt, kidnap or kill a child is scum.  Maybe some lucky Pokemon Go player searching for that rare Pokemon can find a missing child, whether dead or alive, at least to bring closure for their loved ones.  One particular child I want found is Kyron Horman, who disappeared June 4, 2010 after being &#39;picked up&#39; from school for an alleged doctor&#39;s appointment by that &#39;step-mother,&#39; whose name isn&#39;t worth repeating.  Wouldn&#39;t that be the dream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/kyron.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Kyron Horman&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Missing children like Kyron Horman need to be found.&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt; 
	&lt;li&gt;O.J. Simpson&#39;s Murder gloves: In 1994, the nation was shocked when O.J. Simpson&#39;s wife, Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered, allegedly by O.J. Simpson himself.  From the infamous White Bronco car chase down I-405 in Los Angeles to the Trial of the Century that found him Not Guilty, people all around have wondered if O.J. Simpson was guilty or not.  One of the key points of that trial was his gloves.  If only some random Pokemon Go player could find the gloves he wore when he probably killed Nicole Brown Simpson and friend Ron Goldman while looking for that rare Pokemon.  To this day, it&#39;s still the most likely scenario, as no alternate scenario has come forth, it&#39;s likely that O.J. was guilty all along.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/oj-glove.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;O.J. Simpson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Of course the glove didn&#39;t fit.&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/grants-pass.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Grants Pass&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I got rich in Grants Pass...just kidding.  It was only $40.00&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dropped Dolla Bill Y&#39;all: If someone dropped some cash and no one was around, would you take it?  I&#39;m not talking about thousands of dollars, more like $40.  That was the dilemma I faced when I visited Grants Pass, stopping for a picture of their Welcome sign.  I just happened to notice some loose twenties laying in the street.  Sure, if I saw someone actually drop it, that&#39;s different, but no one would identify the money as theirs, and if not me, someone else would.  So, I picked it up and went on with my day and my trip.  If only Pokemon Go could locate dropped dollar bills in the name of Pokemon, that would be sweet.  For the record, I don&#39;t condone stealing money.  Please don&#39;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;A secret meeting where Donald Trump discusses his REAL thoughts: Trump lies about everything.  Moral integrity is a foreign word to him.  No one knows what he&#39;s actually thinking or what he&#39;d actually do to the United States if elected President (my guess involves his favorite number, 11).  Wouldn&#39;t it be great for some Pokemon Go player looking for a Pokemon to stumble upon a secret meeting he&#39;s having admitting to his people what a crock of shit he really is.  One thing&#39;s for sure, Pokemon Go won&#39;t find any proof of Hillary Clinton&#39;s alleged Benghazi lies; they don&#39;t exist...&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
		&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mike-pence-donald-trump.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump and Mike Pence&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s more disturbing, the fact that anyone would actually want to be Donald Trump&#39;s Vice Presidential candidate, as Mike Pence agreed to, or Donald Trump&#39;s chin.  What&#39;s wrong with that thing?&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>A Saison Love</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When I was young, I only saw beer in black and white.  Obviously, I didn&#39;t drink beer, but my Mom occasionally drank beer, mainly when we went to the Oak Hills Brewpub, where she ordered the dark beers, the Porters and Stouts.  From then, I considered good beers to be dark, while crap beers like Bud, Miller and Coors as the bad beers.  It wasn&#39;t until I was 26 that I decided to try beer for the first time, as McMenamins on Allen and Murray. I had a sampler of dark and light beers, mainly interested in the Black Rabbit Porter and Terminator Stout.  From then on, I found myself trying all styles of beers, dark and light, where I learned there&#39;s more than just BMC crap (Bud-Miller-Coors for the uninformed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/colette.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Colette.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Colette, from Great Divide Brewing Company, who recently released Nadia Kali, a Hibiscus Saison I enjoyed quite a bit.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mom though, was a tough cookie to crack to see the other side of beers.  She loved her Porters and Stouts, and with me drinking beer, we took the opportunity to have more beer.  But on a hot summer day on July 15, 2012 at the Raccoon Lodge, my Mom asked me what type of beer I had ordered and asked if she could taste it.  Naturally, I let her sample me beer of choice that night, the Saison Fume, and she was intrigued by it.  The seeds were set, and going out to Hood River for my birthday, we went to pFriem, a Belgian-style brewery along the waterfront. We sampled six beers, which I picked for myself, but my Mom found herself really loving two of the beers I picked.  They were both Saisons, a Black Saison and Lemon Saison.  Suddenly, I found a way to break through that black and white beer bubble.  Ever since, she&#39;s been fascinated with Saisons, perfect for the summertime.  So here are my thoughts on Saisons and why they are the perfect craft beer for all people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Saison I tried was Great Divide Brewing Company&#39;s Collette, which stands out as one of the best readily available Saisons in these parts of the United States.  I immediately took a liking to it and was impressed with its light yet fruity/earthy/spiced tones to it.  To me, that&#39;s what makes a Saison an easy drinking craft beer.  On the one hand, you have the overly hoppy IPA&#39;s, which plenty of American&#39;s love, but they are admittedly not an easy style of beer to get into right away.  It took me a while to appreciate the hops.  On the other side of light beers is the bready floral Pilsner beers which the crappy BMC beers resemble lightly.  Saisons, a Belgian summer beer, doesn&#39;t quite have the hops (since Belgians don&#39;t like their beers hoppy) but also have a more robust flavor (not like Pilsners at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/tank-7.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I vote Tank 7 as the best Saison I&#39;ve had.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great Saison I would highly recommend, one that&#39;s also year-round in these parts, is Boulevard Brewing&#39;s Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale.  Of course, Farmhouse Ale is another term for Saison, so please keep that in mind.  In terms of Saison&#39;s for the masses across America, there aren&#39;t that many, mostly made by breweries during the spring-summer months.  It&#39;s unfortunate there aren&#39;t more readily available Saison&#39;s but with Collette and Tank 7, those to me are enough to get me by.  I do have to admit I have never tried a real Belgian Saison made in Belgium.  I know there is the Saison Dupont that&#39;s considered the best.  I may have to seek that one out since I got my mom on the Saison-train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Oregon, the hop capital of the United States, it isn&#39;t that surprising that Saisons get overlooked, again, only appearing as spring-summer seasonals for those who don&#39;t always stick to the script.  But there are specialty breweries that focus on specialty beer types, like Cascade Brewing&#39;s focus on the Sour Beer market.  Luckily, for Saison fans, there&#39;s Logsdon Farmhouse Ales in Hood River, which as the name suggests, offers plenty of Saisons and other Belgian beers.  I&#39;ve only had one of their beers, the Seizoen Bretta, they are on the more expensive side and come in wine-bottle size, but I can assure you that Seizoen Bretta was quite delicious and worth the money.  I bought it as an anniversary beer, but for the life of me, can&#39;t remember what anniversary it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/seizoen-bretta.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Seizoen Bretta&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Seizoen Bretta, a Brett-alicious Saison&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a final note, I&#39;d like to share what I consider to be the most interesting part of Saisons, Brett.  No, it has nothing to do with my Uncle, but Saisons with Brett are considered to be especially enjoyable and intriguing.  Who exactly is Brett?  It&#39;s short for Brettanomyces, a special kind of yeast that&#39;s found in Belgian beers that gives it a particularly earthy taste.  During my young research on Saisons, I always heard about Brett; which is why I sought out the Seizoen Bretta from Logsdon in the first place.  I hope anyone that likes Saisons or are just curious to seek about the Brett Saisons, or any Saison in general.  A perfect summer beer for those who like to be different, Saisons are often overshadowed by the hoppy IPAs and easily accessible Pilsners, but make a great choice for those looking for an easy to drink beer with complex fruity, earthy and spicy flavors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Enough is Enough</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Enough is enough.  For so long, our country has turned a blind eye on racism, proclaiming that it&#39;s not a big deal like it used to be, just because of Civil Rights and the elimination of Jim Crow laws.  But recent events, particularly the deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas have shown just how horrific racism in the United States really is.  Is there a coincidence that this is happening now at this current time?  Of course not.  This is a by-product of the anger and race baiting politics that Donald Trump has shoved down America&#39;s throats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ferguson-free-hug.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hugs for everyone&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;This is what America&#39;s all about...Coming together.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Listen to Donald Trump speak.  Read between the lines with his stupid tweets.  Whatever the case be, Donald Trump is ANGRY.  He claims he wants to make America great again, but all he does is pit people against one another.  This type of hate-filled angst causes people to be angry and lack the ability to control their emotions.  A level-headed person is far more likely to make rational decisions than angry people whose emotions take control.  We don&#39;t need to hear the thoughts of the angry few.  Most people aren&#39;t like that.  And those who are angry with violent tendencies are often the ones who want to cause physical and mental harm to us.  This has been brewing for years with the racist minority openly complaining about Obama and his worldview.  The racists blame Obama for everything wrong, yet it&#39;s them who are making things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This happened in Baton Rouge, where Alton Sterling was shot dead by police multiple times while he was pinned to the ground by two officers.  A man who didn&#39;t deserve to die, yet too many times in these instances, regardless of race, the Officers always try to pin the victim as a &#39;criminal&#39; for past convictions.  Doesn&#39;t matter.  Regardless of whether there was an altercation or not, it&#39;s not reasonable to shoot a man in the chest at point blank range if you have him pinned to the ground.  Clearly, hate for another leads to mistrust and violence.  The Police often blame those they kill as bad guys while the victims and their loved ones proclaim the Police and others as being overly aggressive due to their appearance.  Police hide behind their badge to justify their actions, rarely, if ever facing conviction for killing innocent people.  Black people often feel targeted for their skin color and sometimes act irrationally due to false accusations.  This hate needs will never stop while others on the sidelines encourage others to act by making these things solely a race issue.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Too often people look solely at people&#39;s skin color and make judgments about them.  Some of it is blatant, while some of it is subconscious.  Some people may not realize it, but they are too focused on appearances when judging people.  This was clearly shown in the death of Philando Castile, who was pulled over in Falcon Heights, Minnesota for a &#39;broken tail-light.&#39;  According to his girlfriend, who was seating next to him in the car, the Officer asked for license and registration (which is standard anytime someone gets pulled over, I know from personal experience), but then told him not to move the moment Philando mentioned having a gun.  No one who would want to shoot an Officer would openly tell them they&#39;re armed, but something must have clicked in the Officer&#39;s head, as suddenly he judged Philando Castile as &#39;a black man with a gun, he must be a gangster that wants to kill me,&#39; rather than a complex human being who, contrary to those negative stereotypes, never had any trouble with the law.  This Officer had hate filled in his heart for whatever reason, and it led him to shoot Philando four times dead, while his girlfriend watched and cried in horror and recorded the aftermath.  No one deserves to die, especially over a &#39;broken tail-light.&#39;  Even worse, the Officer and his backup showed no compassion for him or his girlfriend and 4 year old daughter in the car.  Instead, they watched him die, holding the gun pointed at him and arrested her.  Watching this video, it saddens me and only further supports my point.  The Officer was screaming, while the woman was shockingly calm yet upset.  That&#39;s not rational, that&#39;s anger for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yet instead of trying to heal the wounds, others loudly complain about the &#39;other side&#39; playing the blame game.  These people will try to blame everyone else except the person who actually committed the crime.  They&#39;ll make them look like victims of the Government&#39;s views on society.  This is not a fantasy world, and only encourages more anger from those who feel like they&#39;re being targeted.  This is exactly what happened in Dallas, where Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25 year old African American and former Army reservist, angry with police officers for killing Alton and Philando (among others), set out to kill as many White police officers as he could.  Perhaps if someone had calmed him down and reminded him that most people were upset like he was and violence wasn&#39;t the answer, this may not have happened.  Instead, we had plenty of voices who have and continue to blame Blacks for their own deaths.  They get what they deserve.  They&#39;re only interested in killing cops.  These are the voices of the racist extremists that overshadow the compassionate majority.  To him, his actions were justified by the minority, which led him to murdering cops in anger.  None of this is okay for most, yet the hate filled few openly play race wars and hate games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Joe Walsh decided to delete this tweet. So let&amp;#39;s all retweet it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BY03pLmTyp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/BY03pLmTyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Matthew Rosenberg (@AllMattNYT) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AllMattNYT/status/751281426784329728&quot;&gt;July 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As I read about the deaths in Dallas, it disgusts me that some blame the African American&#39;s and even Obama himself for all of this mess.  It&#39;s downright racist to believe that somehow because Obama is black, that he somehow supports a black man killing multiple police officers.  Obama referred to the shooting as a “vicious, calculated, despicable attack.”  Yet racist people like former congressman Joe Walsh, congressman Steve King, and media joke Sarah Palin don&#39;t even bother to listen to a single word he says.  I doubt any of these racist extremists believe anything Obama says is true.  They are part of the problem, not the solution.  This is not the time to declare &#39;war&#39; against Obama and Black Lives Matter as former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh tweeted in the aftermath.   Nor is it the time to claim the Obama&#39;s own words have led to blacks only interested in killing cops, as racist Iowa congressman and Number 1 Hispanic Hater Steve King proclaimed (which isn&#39;t even remotely true, some cops do act &#39;stupidly,&#39; they&#39;re human).  And last but not least, Sarah Palin, a clueless joke of a former Governor of Alaska who quit to become a famous media whore, her comments aren&#39;t even worth repeating.  After all, she&#39;s the type of person that would blame Obama for having a bad hair day.  Spewing more hate speech is not going to solve anything; it&#39;s only going to create more of the same type of behavior if not worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DallasPoliceShooting?src=hash&quot;&gt;#DallasPoliceShooting&lt;/a&gt; has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obama...Officer Crowley. There were others.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Steve King (@SteveKingIA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SteveKingIA/status/751490647799005184&quot;&gt;July 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is not the time to say hurtful things that target African-Americans.  Nor is this the time to do the same against Police Officers.  Most African-Americans and Police Officers are good people.  In fact, saying hurtful things only encourages others to commit violence out of revenge, hate and spite.  It&#39;s not their fault any of this happens.  The problem is bigger than that.  So while most of America holds on to each other and comforts themselves, we are left to hear the voices of the extremists, who often complain the most and speak the loudest.  Unfortunately, our society notices negativity more than positivity as it attracts more attention.  Turn on the five o&#39;clock news and dare to tell me that you will find anything positive on the news.  You might be lucky if you do, but most stories are the ones that resonate with viewers; the violence, the deaths, the rapes, the burglaries and the general hate we constantly hear about.  This is clear with those like Joe Walsh, who refuses to apologize for his opinions on Obama and the African American community, because to people like him, we can&#39;t blame the cops for anything, therefore, it&#39;s all the Blacks fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joe-walsh.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joe Walsh (the singer)&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;There&#39;s no reason to promote hate, so here&#39;s singer Joe Walsh instead.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So why does it seem that this is happening more commonly than it used to in the past?  There are a variety of factors, amongst them: easier access to news via social media, easier access to guns, especially with assault weapons no longer banned like they used to be, and more extremist behavior leading to a widespread feeling of anger.  This is abundantly clear with Donald Trump, whose words are frequently blasted over the web within seconds.  A man who hardly says anything positive, most people see the hate-filled spew coming out of his mouth, and it makes everyone angry and filled with hate.  His supporters are angry over minorities they believe are the problem with America.  His detractors are angry for targeting minorities and blaming them for everything.  This is not the voice of the American majority, yet this is all we hear about, leading people to have a narrow impression of America.  It&#39;s only the few hate-filled people with violent tendencies that end up causing physical and mental anguish, a task done easier with easy access with guns.  This is not what America is really like, we need to focus on the voices who want to heal, not the few who want to &#39;go to war.&#39;  &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;America is better than this.  We&#39;re all upset by this, as we should be.  But the best solution to heal our wounds is to come together, not tear us apart.  Focus on the love and compassion, not the hate and anger.  I know that not all people are fueled by hate, and most aren&#39;t like this.  It&#39;s up to the passionate majority to dismiss the viewpoints of the racist minority by speaking up.  This is not the time to deny that anything&#39;s wrong, nor to stay silent.  That only allows the Donald Trump&#39;s and Joe Walsh&#39;s of the world to convince us that they&#39;re the truth.  They&#39;re not the voice of the America I love and cherish.  These voices must be minimized through rejection of their bigoted ways.  Only then can the healing process begin.  Enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Donald The Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In an election where Donald Trump has seemingly offended just about everyone that&#39;s not an old white Christian, it was only inevitable that Donald Trump would be accused of Anti-Semitism.  With all the Islamophobia Donald Trump keeps spreading, it&#39;s hard to forget that the Jews have historically been hated on by the majority of non-Jews.  Recently, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with money in the background and a Star of David symbol proclaiming  &#39;Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.&#39;  Trump took it down two hours later and replaced it with a circle replacing the Jewish Star.  Does this make Donald Trump Anti-Semitic or just plain stupid.  Here are my thoughts on Trump&#39;s history of Anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/frozen.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Frozen&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Offended yet?  You shouldn&#39;t be...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true that Donald Trump will say or do anything to get attention.  He&#39;d be the first in line to criticize Jews if he felt he would get a voting advantage from it, just like he does to the Hispanics, Muslims, Blacks, Asians, Millennials, Women, Liberals, Disabled, Presidents, Secretary of State&#39;s, Governors, Senators, Congressmen and Congresswomen, Supreme Court Justice&#39;s, Catholics, Poor, LGBTers, well, just about everyone that&#39;s not white or Christian.  In this respect, it&#39;s hard to say whether Donald Trump is a genuine bigot or an acting bigot.  Either way, he&#39;s a bigot.  But while all this goes on, Donald Trump has shown a softness for White Supremacists and Dictators across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has always jumped on actions and/or words committed by minorities, whether it&#39;s ISIS inspired terrorists like the scoundrel who committed the Orlando and San Bernardino acts, or any black or Hispanic male that shoots and kills someone.  But when it comes to White Supremacists, Donald Trump often agrees with their ideas and retweets them.  Just like he did with that stupid Anti-Semitic Hillary picture.  He&#39;s liked their messages before, he showed little anger when being endorsed by the infamous former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke.  But when an undocumented immigrant in Oregon who was deported six times kills a few people, a story that hardly made national news, Donald Trump was screaming about it in anger.  This seemingly Aryan viewpoint of Donald Trump&#39;s makes him look Anti-Semitic, but is he really Anti-Semitic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump-star.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Star&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Offended now?  Now that&#39;s more offensive.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump didn&#39;t create that image; a White Supremacist did.  But that doesn&#39;t stop the picture from being Anti-Semitic.  The loser who made this drawing clearly plays on negative Jewish stereotypes of Jews having money and being corrupt with money.  While it&#39;s true that there are other hexagrams (a word Donald Trump is probably too stupid to know what one is) used by other religions; Christians, Hindus, even Muslims; most people would probably identify it as associated with Judaism.  Clearly, Donald Trump was too stupid to see that the image was Anti-Semitic when he posted it, but took it down after receiving criticism.  All in a day&#39;s work for someone who claims to be Pro-Israel yet can&#39;t recognize an image as being anti-Semitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump and his idiot associates tried to claim the image was not Anti-Semitic, that the star in question was just an ordinary star or a Sheriff&#39;s star badge, but these dweebs fail to recognize that an ordinary star is most commonly associated with having five points, while a Sheriff&#39;s star can have anywhere from five to seven points.  Hardly universal for a Sheriff&#39;s star.  But what Donald Trump and his idiot associates are clueless to is that the star itself doesn&#39;t make it Anti-Semitic, it&#39;s the reinforcement of negative stereotypes associated with Jews and money.  He can&#39;t change the meaning of a drawing he didn&#39;t create.  As my Dad loves to say, &quot;consider the source.&quot;  Something Donald Trump never bothers to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Donald Trump would make an absolutely ridiculous claim of Anti-Semitism against Disney for featuring a regular hexagram on a children&#39;s book for a children&#39;s movie; Frozen, an animated film released in 2013 about a princess who goes on a journey of some sort.  Anyone who thinks that image is offensive is clearly senile and demented.  There are no hidden messages in this book.  It&#39;s just a book cover.  This is the definition of an ordinary star, one that mentions &quot;with 50 stickers.&quot;  There&#39;s nothing slanderous nor racist about stickers from a kid&#39;s book made by Disney.  Sorry Donald, that&#39;s not a Star of David.  There&#39;s nothing Jewish about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is Donald Trump against my religion?  Probably not, but he&#39;s stupid and ignorant for not knowing something that&#39;s anti-Semitic.  He has a son-in-law who&#39;s Jewish, with Jewish grandchildren, so I seriously doubt Trump hates Jewish people.  But not condemning Anti-Semitism and blindly running a campaign for White Supremacists is a sure sign that Donald Trump doesn&#39;t love Jewish people either.  To this idiot, it&#39;s all about winning by any means necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Halfway through 2016 - My Year in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We&#39;ve reached the end of June, which essentially means we&#39;re halfway through the year.  I&#39;ve had a successful year so far, and I&#39;m aiming to continue that with an even better second half of the year.  So here&#39;s to me, but also to those who have supported me along the way, because I wouldn&#39;t be the person I am without the loving support of my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/adam-barley.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Adam&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I&#39;ve won this quarter (and half).  Thanks for the encouragement today, Barley the Hop.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My year started off pretty bad; I was really sick.  It started just before my Dad&#39;s birthday on December 30th, and I don&#39;t know what got me, but it left me feeling awful.  I developed Walking Pneumonia, which helped me realize that there are far worse things than an Ear Infection.  I ended up with one of them afterwards, and that was no fun either.  It was not a good time for me, but it could have been a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite that, I had a lot to look for and a lot I knew I was rebound greatly.  The reason for that, I was aiming for a full time job at Seterus.  After submitting my application and going through the interview process, I finally got my first time job as a Correspondence Support Specialist.  All the hard work I put in finally paid off, as I officially became an IBMer.  My first official day as an IBMer was February 15th, and I haven&#39;t looked back since.  It&#39;s the beginning of the next stage of my master improvement plan I&#39;ve been working on for the past five years or so.  Still a few steps left in that game but it&#39;s a significant milestone for me.  In fact, it was June 29th of last year that I began my career at Seterus.  It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting, but as my Mom always says, &#39;things happen for a reason,&#39; and somehow, I ended up at the right place at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an official IBMer has its perks.  Asides from a better paycheck, better benefits and 401K, I also get lots of PTO.  That led to my biggest trip so far in the year, a drive to Walla Walla, Washington, where I visited the area and beyond, with the biggest prize at the end, the mesmerizing Palouse Falls.  Walla Walla was a nice charming little town with lots of shops, wineries and surrounding views of the mountains, but Palouse Falls, and the drive up to there was amazing in itself, with the funky Palouse hills that looked like another planet.  It was a fun trip overall, and made easier thanks to PTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IBM.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;IBM&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I&#39;m an IBMer!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another highlight has been my evolving programming skills, including this blog page.  I&#39;ve made projects out of Ruby on Rails and various JavaScript techniques, along with converting this blog page through Jekyll.  I&#39;m working on a project made from Ember.js, a lot of fun with that one.  Stay tuned.  I&#39;ve also found a niche with my writing.  I&#39;m able to express myself more freely and happily.  I particularly like the live blog posts I did for Kobe&#39;s last game and the NBA Draft.  Those to me are where I&#39;m at my best, since I&#39;m thinking on my toes to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the first half of the year contains my favorite day of the year, May 10, a.k.a. my birthday.  I took the day off from work, which I can now do without worrying about not getting paid, and like many of my birthdays, the weather was perfect!  I spent the day with my Mom in Hood River, my favorite hip town along the Columbia River Gorge.  For lunch, my Mom and I went to pFriem, a brewery along the riverfront.  The lunch was perfect, along with all the beers we tried.  I enjoyed the Belgian Strong Dark and Pêche.  My Mom really found her liking for Saisons, the Black Saison and Lemon Saison. Now my Mom talks about nothing but Saisons with beer.  I love it!  To me, that&#39;s the best part of it all.  After a nice trip to Hood River, taking pictures with my Olloclip I received for my birthday, and getting a pFriem t-shirt with the bear cheering Op Uw Gezondheid, we headed back home before having a nice dinner at Decarli with my sister and Dad.  I love my birthday, no matter how old I&#39;m getting, and as an added bonus, my co-workers decorated my desk and gave me a birthday card.  Yippee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Hood River is nice!  Being there on my birthday made it nicer!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the year has also been good to my family.  My Mom had a successful event for Shir Tikvah called Shirlandia.  The people there just loved it!  She called it her best event ever.  I didn&#39;t go, but much praise to my Mom and the great work she does for Shir Tikvah.  Hearing all these people talk great about my Mom makes me a proud son.  My Dad has been hard at work too for Steam Engineering.  His hard work and dedication helped them get a big client, Harry&#39;s Fresh Foods.  I&#39;m glad for my Dad.  Now if they can only catch that a**hole Dave, my Dad will be really good.  And how can I forget about my wonderful sister Jenn, whose work as a stay-at-home coder for PBS West continues to impress her bosses wherever they are.  Jenn&#39;s come a long way from her unhappy days at her old job and continues to amaze me with her knowledge of medical terminology and radiology skills.  Having my family happy makes me even happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve having a great year so far, despite the rocky start.  I feel good about myself and know that this is only the beginning for me.  I have plenty of stuff planned for the latter half of the year and I&#39;m feeling great!  I hope all of you reading this are great as well.  Life is good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Brexit 101</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I wasn&#39;t going to say anything about the global phenomenon known stupidly as &#39;Brexit,&#39; it doesn&#39;t really affect me personally since I don&#39;t live in the United Kingdom.  It&#39;s really an issue out of my league.  But after seeing the English soccer team lose an epic upset to Iceland in Euro 2016, I&#39;ve decided to say a few words based solely so I can use the following joke: England just brexited Euro 2016.  The timing couldn&#39;t be any better.  Here are my thoughts on Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/iceland.jpeg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Thanks Iceland and its game winning striker Kolbeinn Sigþórsson for a perfectly timed Brexit joke.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Thanks Iceland and its game winning striker Kolbeinn Sigþórsson for a perfectly timed Brexit joke.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A brief brundown on Brexit.  Britains braimed brat the Bruropean Brunion is brad.  48% broted to Remain and 52% broted to Leave.  Brow brome breople brave bregrets brecause the Leave brupporters brade their braims brased on Xenophobia and the Breconomy is brinking.  Brat&#39;s the brasics of Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Enough of the stupid portmanteaus.  I hate portmanteaus, but that&#39;s another blog post by itself.  The whole notion of Brexit is based on conservative based Immigrant fearmongering, blaming them for all our problems.  It&#39;s no different to what&#39;s going on here in the United States with Donald Trump&#39;s blatant Immigrant-bashing Xenophobia.  Heck, one of the driving forces behind Brexit, former London Mayor Boris Johnson, looks like a British knock-off of Donald Trump.  The similarities between the two are uncanny, minus the British appearance for Boris Johnson.  Maybe it&#39;s the look after all.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If I lived in the United Kingdom, I would vote to remain in the European Union.  I believe in collaboration with the rest of Europe over North Korea-based isolation any day.  The people who believe the European Union was making them &#39;slaves&#39; somehow don&#39;t understand what freedom truly is.  It&#39;s not about fear of Immigrants.  Yet some people continue to scare people into believing the Immigrants and Poor are the root of all our world&#39;s problems.  These people claim they&#39;re somehow affected by Immigrants.  Most people probably don&#39;t interact with Immigrants on a daily basis nor understand that most of them are harmless.  It&#39;s no different to our attitude here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/boris-johnson.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&#39;s British brother from another mother, Boris Johnson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Donald Trump&#39;s British brother from another mother, Boris Johnson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&#39;s no surprise our Idiot &#39;Republican&#39; Presidential Candidate Donald Trump supports this.  He claims &#39;The U.S. is next.&#39;  But we&#39;re not part of the European Union.  We&#39;re not enslaved by anything, especially immigrants.  But Donald Trump wants to scare people.  That&#39;s his only game.  Immigrants aren&#39;t the problem for us.  They&#39;re not the problem for the U.K. or anywhere else in the world.  It&#39;s people like Trump who are the problem, greedy power-seeking egomaniacs wanting to do as they please with no regard for anyone else.  That won&#39;t change in the U.K. whoever becomes the Prime Minister now that David Cameron resigned.  It will be someone else like Boris Johnson abusing the power at the expense of the common-man instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/trump-scotland.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Out in Scotland merely to promote his golf course, where the majority of Scotland voted to REMAIN in the European Union.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Out in Scotland merely to promote his golf course, where the majority of Scotland voted to REMAIN in the European Union.  Has Donald Trump ever gotten the memo?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Brexit is a bad idea.  It reeks of fear-mongering with no solutions to actually help the United Kingdom.  It won&#39;t free them from anything.  It makes them look weaker and more isolated from the rest of Europe.  The European Union was enacted to prevent World War III or any other World War.  The United Kingdom has always been our strongest ally and it&#39;s a shame that people would buy into this hate filled garbage.  It&#39;s a preview of what life would be like with Dictator Donald Trump as Supreme Overlord of the United States of Donald Trump.  Thank god for the little guy, like Iceland, to show the English how it&#39;s done.  Poetic justice couldn&#39;t have written a better metaphor than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>NBA Draft - The Future is Now</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;4:32 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Tonight is the 2016 NBA Draft, where the young stars join their new teams.  For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like they did last year with D&#39;Angelo Russell.  While Russell wasn&#39;t an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype.  Who will the Lakers take with the number 2 picks.  All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be announced in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/brandon-ingram.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Brandon Ingram.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Here&#39;s hoping Brandon Ingram is the next Lakers All-Star&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:37 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;The first pick is announced, and no surprise, it&#39;s Ben Simmons, the Australian sensation from LSU.  I would have loved for the Lakers to get this kid, has lots of potential, but no surprise he goes to Philadelphia.  Maturity issues aside, this kid has great skills.  With Philadelphia done with its rebuilding project, he can be the anchor for a franchise desperate for some wins.  They deserve some brotherly love, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:43 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;The Lakers have the second pick, and they take Brandon Ingram, with little surprise.  Ingram is a natural replacement to Kobe with his size and length, along with his shooting and perimeter skills.  Though I think Buddy Hield has potential to be a superstar and would have loved to see him taken by the Lakers, Ingram is the safer pick.  He&#39;s a little skinny, but so was Durant as a young&#39;un.  It&#39;s too early to give up on D&#39;Angelo Russell.  Hearing ESPN take about a fantasy trade of Russell for Okafor is quite ironic.  Most people thought they would take Okafor but took Russell instead.  Equally ironic that Philadelphia is trying to trade him now, and rumbles about Russell with both two having character issues.  Boston has the third pick, a huge steal from Brooklyn from the Pierce-Garnett trade.  They&#39;re trying to get a veteran for the pick.  Now the drama begins.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:51 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Danny Ainge is known for trades in the drafts, they have a bright future with Isaiah Thomas at the point guard, a great coach with Brad Stevens and plenty of cap room to make deals.  Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, someone else.  Yep, it&#39;s Jaylen Brown from California.  A surprise to some, but I think Brown has potential to be a star.  Boston doesn&#39;t need a point guard and big men are missing at the top of the draft list.  I suspect Boston will keep him.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:53 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Phoenix has the fourth pick, and it&#39;s unknown which direction they will go.  Eric Bledsoe is talented but injury-prone, while they traded the wrong point guard by sending Isaiah Thomas to acquire Brandon Knight.  Random Boston thought, Jaylen Brown was the captain of his chess team in middle school?!?  Wow!  But back to Phoenix, they have decent players but weren&#39;t healthy.  I think Buddy Hield would be great for Phoenix, but Phoenix needs size, so a bigger man might be on the horizon.  Marquese Chriss from Washington, Dragan Bender, the Croatian Man of Mystery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/dragan-bender.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Dragan Bender.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Bonus points for playing in Israel, Dragan Bender.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:58 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;And with the fourth pick, Phoenix selects...Dragan Bender, the Croatian Man of Mystery, who last played for Maccabi Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s best team.  He&#39;s only 18, so he didn&#39;t play that much according to the ESPN announcers.  Bonus points for playing in Israel.  Will he be the next Kristaps Porzingis (the fourth pick last year) or the next Darko Milicic?  We&#39;ll have to wait and see.  Either way, Minnesota has the fifth pick, and they need a point guard with a shot.  Buddy Hield is realistic, but Providence point guard Kris Dunn is the highest rated point guard in the draft, with defensive capabilities, which is new coach Tom Thibodeau&#39;s calling card.  We&#39;ll find out after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:06 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Minnesota&#39;s pick is in, and they select...Kris Dunn, the guard from Providence.  Sorry John Calipari, but Kris Dunn is the perfect choice for Tom Thibodeau.  Whether he becomes a star, who knows, I don&#39;t know much about his game, but Minnesota has a bright future with Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns and Zach Lavine.  Now New Orleans has the sixth pick.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:09 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;New Orleans needs some guards to complement Anthony Davis.  A disappointing season last year, Davis clearly needs someone else who can perform consistently.  Aaron Gordon, Tyreke Evans and Jrue Holiday have been all inconsistent.  Oh, and Kris Dunn has some shiny shoes courtesy of JC Penneys.  Yippee.  But sad childhood story for Dunn, he deserves credit.  Hope he helps the Timberwolves out.  Back to New Orleans, they need Buddy.  And watching the NBA Reporter Alert on ESPN, it appears that&#39;s the direction they&#39;re going.  Official announcement waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:13 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;And they took Buddy Hield with the sixth pick.  Great pick for New Orleans, and a perfect fit for them.  I like this kid&#39;s shooting and spunk.  Steph Curry-like potential, clearly the player New Orleans needs to complement Anthony Davis.  And he&#39;s a Senior, so there&#39;s plenty of experience there.  They just compared him to Voshon Lenard, there&#39;s a name I haven&#39;t heard in years.  Gotta love the Bahamas spirit the Buddy Hield brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/dunn-kris-gucci.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Kris Dunn&#39;s Shoes&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Look at Kris Dunn&#39;s shoes.  Wow!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:17 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Denver has the seventh pick, and they have no direction.  They don&#39;t have a star, a bunch of talented B star players like Kenneth Faried and Danilo Galinari.  They haven&#39;t had a star since they traded Carmelo Anthony (this pick was part of that trade).  The jury&#39;s still out on Emmanuel Mudiay, so Denver can go anywhere with this pick, but appear set on Kentucky&#39;s Jamal Murray (now John Calipari can stop lobbying this kid).  He almost went to Oregon, but ended up at Kentucky with Coach Cal.  Yet Oregon made it to the Elite Eight and was a #1 seed.  But anyways...&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:21 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Denver took Jamal Murray, the best rated player left in the draft.  Calipari believes he will lead all rookies in scoring.  We&#39;ll see, but I can&#39;t stand Calipari.  I&#39;ve mentioned him more times than any other coach in this blog.  For Denver, nice pick, but they need direction and a cornerstone.  His comparison, Michael Redd, another player who I haven&#39;t heard about in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:23 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Now we come to the most dysfunctional team in the NBA, the Sacramento Kings.  Anyone who thought George Karl would mesh with DeMarcus Cousins is clearly stupid, as their issues clouded everything with that franchise.  Cousins is the best pure center in the NBA, Sacramento made a mistake firing Michael Malone two years ago.  But David Joerger makes sense as a coach for Cousins.  Rajon Rondo looked decent as their point guard, and they still have Rudy Gay, though he&#39;s likely trade bait.  WIth a nice new simple logo, who should Sacramento take?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:26 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Sacramento takes Marquese Chriss, the power forward from the Washington Fuskies.  He gets the stay in purple, but I don&#39;t know much about him or his game, since Washington is still lagging behind Oregon.  But they&#39;re trading this pick to the Phoenix Suns, who are getting Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender, according to ESPN&#39;s Andy Katz.  Phoenix has purple too.  First trade of the night!  According to the stats, Marquese Chriss got more fouls than anyone else in the history of the world it seems.  No one ever talks about foul stats.  No wonder I don&#39;t know about him.  I doubt he would&#39;ve done much for Sacramento, and I would be surprised if he becomes anything more than an average player.&lt;/p&gt;
	
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:31 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Toronto, fresh off their best season ever, has the ninth pick, courtesy of the New York Knicks via Denver.  If DeMar DeRozan doesn&#39;t bolt, their first priority, Toronto will still contend in the East.  They shockingly beat the Cavs two times in the Eastern Conference Finals.  They select Jakob Poeltl, the University of Utah Austrian sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:33 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Jakob Poeltl played well at Utah, but didn&#39;t do much against Oregon in the Pac-12 Conference Championship game.  He was the Pac-12 Player of the Year.  Toronto is a good place for him; they don&#39;t need immediate contributions from &#39;the best Austrian import since the Von Trapp family.&#39;  International player going to Toronto, perfect!  Now the tenth pick, Milwaukee.  Commercial!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:40 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Milwaukee has the tenth pick, another disappointment this year, the Bucks need some shooters but the highest rated players are bigs, and they need rebounding as well.  Steph Curry made more three pointers in 2016 than the entire Milwaukee Bucks team in 2016.  Milwaukee can go anywhere, and they select...Thon Maker, the super mysterious Power Forward from Australia, whose age is in question.  Born in Sudan and escaped at the age of 6, moved to Australia for 8 years, moved to the United States at 14, then moved to Canada.  That&#39;s a mouthful.  A high risk-high reward type of player, with the mystery angle the biggest issue.  The buzz word the analysts said is &#39;unique.&#39;  He definitely appears unique from everything they&#39;ve said about him.  Similar to Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Greek Freak, Thon Maker is technically the only high school player in the draft, albeit a very odd way.  It&#39;s 5:44 pm and I&#39;m hungry for dinner, so now it&#39;s time for hot dogs.  I&#39;ll be back soon…&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;I&#39;m back!&lt;/h3&gt;
	
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:05 pm - &lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m back for a rundown of all the things I missed while I was making dinner, eating dinner, doing the dishes, and because it&#39;s trash night, took out the trash.  Here we go:  Orlando took Arvydas Sabonis&#39;s kid Domantas Sabonis with the 11th pick.  If only he was like his Dad in his prime.  Another reminder of what could have been for the Blazers with Arvydas Sabonis.  Even more shocking, Orlando traded him, Victor Oladipo and Ersan Ilyosava to Oklahoma City for Serge Ibaka!  The first major trade of the night.  I always felt OKC needed to trade Ibaka to become truly elite.  They fell just short against Golden State, and whether Kevin Durant comes back or not is the biggest mystery in the NBA period.  But Ibaka, though talented, was expendable for OKC.  He became a jump shooter when he would have been better as an interior player for OKC&#39;s sake.  They traded James Harden just to keep Ibaka...Chicago took Denzel Valentine with the 14th pick.  Nice tough kid from Michigan State who cost me street cred for losing to Middle Tennessee State in the NCAA tournament.  But Chicago is rebuilding, with Derrick Rose being traded to the Knicks...Atlanta took DeAndre Bembry from St. Joseph&#39;s with the 21st pick.  I liked his game when he played against Oregon in the NCAA Tournament, a street-smart player with the best afro since Josh Childress back in 2004 (who was also taken by the Atlanta Hawks).  A surprisingly high number of international players taken, including...Georgios Papagiannis (Greece), Juan Hernangomez (Spain), Guerschon Yabusele (France), Ante Zizic (Croatia), and just taken by Philadelphia with the 24th pick, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot (France) - &lt;strong&gt;7:18 pm&lt;/strong&gt;  - I&#39;ve never heard of any of these players, I figured these are the types of players taken in the second round.  If one of those players pans out, I&#39;ll be the first to salute them, guarantee.  Oh, and Furkan Korkmaz (Turkey) with the 26th pick by wait for it...Philadelphia again!&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/img/deandre-bembry.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;DeAndre Bembry&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Look at DeAndre Bembry&#39;s Afro!&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:39 pm - &lt;/strong&gt; Three picks left in the first round, who wants to bet at least one of them will be an International player?  With the last three picks from Phoenix, San Antonio and Golden State, chances are high.  8 (true) International players already in the first round, tying an NBA record, with a chance to be broken.  The draft hosts are talking about college freshman being able to come back to school if they aren&#39;t taken in the first round.  Bad idea, then everyone would enter the NBA Draft, leaving their schools in the balance.  Players should own their decisions of leaving and staying in the draft.  Now we get a Raef LaFrentz reference for Phoenix&#39;s 28th pick, Skal Labissiere from Kentucky.  Ouch!  His family survived the Haiti earthquake, how sad.  And he&#39;s wearing a pink suit too.  Is pink the new black?  The last time the Spurs had a second-to-the-last first round pick, they took Tony Parker.  They always find steals, except Ian Mahmimi.  As for tonight, they selected Dejounte Murray, point guard for the Fuskies.  Seriously?  Oregon made it to the Elite Eight and it&#39;s Washington with two first round picks?  I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/img/timothe-luwawu-cabarrot.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Pink uniforms?!?  Only a Frenchman can pull it off.  Thanks Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot!&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:51 pm - &lt;/strong&gt; One more pick in the first round, one more chance for a foreign player to be selected to set the record.  And it&#39;s Golden State, who lost the same amount of games in the postseason as they did in the regular season, 9.  All the hard work in the regular season, one win away from winning the championship, and they lost three straight to Cleveland, without an answer to stop superhuman LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.  They threw their chance away like Steph Curry did his mouthguard after fouling out and getting ejected from Game 6 of the Finals.  They acted overconfident and played overconfident.  Cleveland deserved the title and outplayed them.  Brief note, Dejounte Murray&#39;s shoes looked like girls shoes, but it&#39;s to honor a cousin who died last summer.  I&#39;ll give credit for that.  But the final pick of the first round is in, and it&#39;s..................Damian Jones, a center from Vanderbilt.  So much for my International player.  Time for the second round.  And I&#39;m done for the night.  Will Oregon&#39;s Elgin Cook get selected?  Who will the Lakers take in the second round?  Those questions aren&#39;t blog worthy.  Good night!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Editors Note: The University of Washington&#39;s nickname is purposely misspelled as Fuskies, that was by choice from the old days at Oregon when people would say &quot;Huck the Fuskies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Big Short vs. Spotlight - Which Movie was better</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I was asked to compare two recent movies and Oscar nominated and winning movies from this years Academy Awards.  The challenger on the left is The Big Short, which won Best Adapted Screenplay.  The champion on the right is Spotlight, which won Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.  So which movie did I think was better?  Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/oscar.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;The Oscars&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Which movie should have won the Oscar?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Both movies are well done, featuring well known actors and are based on fairly recent events.  The Big Short, starring Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling, is based on the housing crisis that led to the recession, while Spotlight, starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams, is based on the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team uncovering the mass coverup of child sexual abuse by the numerous Catholic Priests in Boston (and all over the world).  Both have the realistic angle since the events actually happened (I’m not going to argue whether the facts are completely true, but that’s irrelevant at this point.  It’s not The Martian to say the least.  But their approach is quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;One thing I really liked about The Big Short was its light-hearted approach.  Though the drama was there, it showcased some lightly comedic efforts in presenting the film.  With this approach, director Adam McKay, more known for comedy films, is able to reach a different audience for those who strictly like dramas.  In addition, scenes from various celebrities explaining some of the concepts presented in the film, such as CDO’s (consolidated debt organizations) and synthetic CDO’s.  I didn’t particularly know the celebrities that well and some of them seem odd to explain them (i.e. Selena Gomez, who was like 15 when the actual events happened), but it helped the audience better understand what exactly was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Spotlight, on the other hand, takes a more traditional approach of raw emotional storytelling.  Clearly, their story didn’t require that much explanation, so instead, director Tom McCarthy was able to focus on the story and emotions of the characters in the film.  The amount of detail featured in the investigation deserves praise.  Spotlight takes a safer route with its presentation, while The Big Short took a slightly less serious approach.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;The Big Short&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The acting in The Big Short is well done, particularly Christian Bale’s role as Michael Burry, an eccentric hedge fund manager who looks like a slacker yet is able to determine the housing market is crumbling before anyone sees it.  Bale is well known for taking on a variety of roles and his extreme dedication to each role he takes, and his performance showcases this as he perfectly shows the slacker who’s quite intelligent yet dresses like a slob.  Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling also played their characters well, with Carell playing a hedge fund manager with distaste for the industry while Gosling plays a trader that’s cunning, smart and caring at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The acting in Spotlight is also superb, with Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams deserving the most praise.  Ruffalo plays reporter Michael Rezendes, whose dedication to finding the truth and emotional mission to help the victims makes him stand out, along with McAdams character, who provides a female touch.  The way the reporters handled talking to the victims was particularly touching.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The one thing that I didn’t care for about The Big Short was its transition from ‘Oh my god, we’re going to get rich off of this!’ to ‘Oh my god, the market has completely crashed, woe is me.’  It kind of seemed too abrupt to me after building the movie up as a ‘heist’ movie.  Overall, the scenes depicting the change were well done but it left me kind of depressed after the movie ended.  The two young characters looked like schmucks with their lack of appreciation for this, until Brad Pitt’s character criticizes them for it.  Done well, but it made some of the characters kind of unlikeable for being greedy.  Spotlight, on the other hand, featured moral characters that weren’t driven by greed, but by the truth.  Michael Keaton’s character, the editor of the Spotlight team, stands out for past digressions (which I won’t reveal for those not wanting spoilers).&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Spotlight&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, Spotlight’s plot didn’t particularly stand out.  I’ve seen other newspaper conspiracy type films with better and more interesting; Zodiac, the 2007 film about the Zodiac Killer had a far more interesting plot of the newspaper conspiracy trying to figure out who the Zodiac Killer was.  That to me was a far better and more fascinating film than the uncovering of the Catholic church protecting its pedophile priests.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Despite neither movie being perfect and having its flaws, I found The Big Short to be more interesting and better of the two films.  Working in the mortgage servicing industry, I learned a thing or two about mortgage loans and the housing market in general.  It was a more original approach to give it the light-hearted touch rather than Spotlight, the more conventional film.  Spotlight is still better than the previous Best Picture, Birdman, a movie I found to be odd, but not as good as some of the past Best Picture winners; Slumdog Millionaire (2008), No Country for Old Men (2007), The Departed (2006) and Million Dollar Baby (2004) are four films from this millennium that won Best Picture that I loved.  Great emotional acting is always great to have, but at the end of the day, I’m driven by plot and originality more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
