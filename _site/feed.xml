        <title>The Brand New Lakers</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's only the end of November, and already, the young new Lakers have proven that not only is the Kobe era over, but that they're much further ahead of schedule than anyone anticipated.  The young Lakers just won a close game in Chicago tonight, with a 10-10 record, already more than half the wins they had all of last year.  The Lakers have been the biggest surprise in the league this year and there are plenty of reasons to love these Lakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/luke-walton.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Luke Walton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Luuuuuuuuuuke Walton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Luke Walton was always a fan favorite when he played with the Lakers as a young'un, the passion and energy of his play made him an important asset.  It's what made Luke the first and only choice to take over the coaching job after Byron Scott was fired.  Luke Walton did wonders holding the talented Warriors afloat while Steve Kerr was out.  Yet his job with the Lakers has been so much better so far.  No real stars yet on this Lakers team, but plenty of talented young players who work hard and play hard.  These guys embody the style of play Luke Walton brought when he was a player, and he's an obvious choice for Coach of the Year right now.&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;One thing the Lakers have proven this year so far is that their bench is not only the best and most productive in the league, it's almost as good as their starting five.  The Lakers have the Sixth Man of the Year on the roster but is it Jordan Clarkson or Lou Williams?  Sweet Lou Williams has won the award before and is born to succeed off the bench.  He currently ranks third in the league in fourth quarter points.  That's what Lou Williams does, and he's helped give the Lakers bench an identity.  Jordan Clarkson, on the other hand, is new the the bench role, and has flourished in the role, bringing a bench sidekick for Lou but also provides toughness and swagger on the defensive side of the court.  And while Lou Williams is the veteran leader of the bench, it's Larry Nance Jr. and his hustle that defines the Lakers character more than anyone.  His ability to go after loose balls, fight on every play and bring down the house with every slam (all of which would make his dad proud) is just what makes the Lakers tough to play against.  They always come out with the energy.  Also on the bench is rookie Brandon Ingram, who's shown potential to be a great player down the road, and Tarik Black, who has been a quality backup center when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lou-williams.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Lou Williams&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Lou Williams&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;Before the season started, I thought D'Angelo Russell would be the most improved player.  While he has improved from his rookie season, it's his surprise backcourt mate, Nick Young, who has been the real most improved on the team.  When Nick Young, aka Swaggy P, first joined the team, he gave the Lakers some entertaining value with his offense and fun attitude.  He fit well with Mike D'Antoni, even though he was not the right coach for the team.  But he fell off the face of the Earth under Byron Scott; not a good fit at all, and some doubted Nick Young would even make the team.  But Luke Walton has managed to light a fire in Nick Young, not only offensively, but on the defensive side as well.  He's managed to do a complete 180 from before, where I thought the Lakers would be better off trading him, to suddenly being an important asset alongside the last player anyone thought he would ever share a backcourt with, D'Angelo Russell.  Truth be told, Nick Young was getting too 'Hollywood' while he was with Iggy Azalea.  The last thing the Lakers needed was another Lamar Odom.  So I'll salute Nick Young for his comeback.  Who knew he'd be the longest tenured Laker currently on the roster.&lt;/p&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;The rest of the Lakers starting lineup provides toughness and stability (when healthy, of course), as Julius Randle continues to improve his game at the Power Forward position, while Luol Deng, although not putting up the numbers in the past, provides a calming presence to the team.  His veteran leadership is important, especially for the growth of Brandon Ingram.  Even Timofey Mozgov, no matter how overpaid he is, has proven to be a good enough player for Luke Walton's system to sometimes make you forget that.  Definitely an improvement from Roy Hibbert last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nick-young.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Nick Young&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Swaggy P got that Swagger Back&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;The Lakers have the perfect attitude and style of play that makes opponents not want to play them.  They're young, hungry, hard-working and passionate whenever they play.  It gives Laker fans like me hope for the future.  They've already beaten Golden State, Oklahoma City, Atlanta (twice, sucks to be you Dwight Howard!) and Chicago.  They've come back from 10+ point deficits, gone wire to wire, and never quit.  The Lakers aren't title-ready yet; they lack a closer like Kobe in his prime, but the Lakers are well ahead of schedule.  Thankfully, the Lakers are in good position to finally give up that first round pick they gave to Phoenix (now with Philadelphia) for the bad deal for Steve Nash.  The future is now for Luke Walton's Lakers, and it's about time the league started to fear the Lakers again.  The past few years were painful and sad, and the league better watch out.  The only thing to make it even better would be to have Larry Nance Jr. enter the Slam Dunk contest steal the title from Zach LaVine.  That would be really sweet, he was born to win it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The End of the Rich Brooks Era</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; For as long as I’ve been a fan of the Oregon Ducks, which started with their 2001 Fiesta Bowl blowout against Colorado and blossomed when I went to school there for three years, I’ve always respected the football team’s family-styled approach to coaching.  Starting with Rich Brooks, who coached the Ducks from 1977 to 1994, when he brought the Ducks to respectability and a Rose Bowl appearance before departing for the NFL, the Ducks always had, for the most part, a close knit family tree of coaching, as the ‘Next Man Up’ mantra reigned supreme.  But that era has ended today as the Oregon Ducks fired Mark Helfrich as their head coach after a disappointing 4-8 season.  Whether he was the right coach or whether the Ducks will replace him with someone better remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure, the Ducks are now just another program looking to win.  So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mark-helfrich.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Mark Helfrich&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mark Helfrich&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, it didn't matter how mediocre to bad Rich Brooks was as a coach; this year was their worst record since 1991 when Rich Brooks went 3-8.  But while the Ducks were patient back then with average expectations, times have changed and the Ducks are now impatient with extremely high expectations after reaching new heights with two National Championship appearances in the past six years.  After Rich Brooks left, the Ducks remained confident with the Rich Brooks way, bringing offensive coordinator Mike Bellotti as the coach.  And Oregon continued to blossom from a mediocre team to one that consistently made bowl games and competed for (then) Pac-10 titles.  But even the Ducks needed a boost, and Mike Bellotti managed to flip the program on its heels by bringing in a miracle guru from New Hampshire, Chip Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Ducks became the talk of the country when Chip Kelly, an unknown offensive coordinator from New Hampshire, took over as offensive coordinator and turned the offense on its heels.  And a couple of years later, Bellotti retired and handed the reigns to Chip, where the Ducks became the top team of the Pac-10 (later the Pac-12).  Suddenly, Oregon was a national powerhouse, with a high-flying offense that was difficult to stop and all the rage.  But despite keeping the family intact, Chip Kelly didn't share that ideal himself; feeling destined for greater things and bored of college football (along with minor violations that would’ve cost him anyhow), Chip took his talents to the NFL and like before, it was the next man up as Mark Helfrich, the offensive coordinator, was hired as the new head coach.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;But what started out as Mark's greatest strengths led to his downfall: Marcus Mariota.  Like Larry Coker, who led the great 2001 Miami Hurricanes to a National Championship in his first season as coach after taking over for Butch Davis, Helfrich inherited a lot of great talent, led by the man who became Oregon's first Heisman Trophy winner, Marcus Mariota.  Of course, Helfrich got all the praises for leading Oregon to the first National Championship in the playoff era, with the perfection of Marcus Mariota leading the way, but it's easy to win when you have a player perfectly built for a great offense.  It's maintaining that success that cost Helfrich, exemplified by their defensive woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/rich-brooks.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Rich Brooks&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Simpler times with Rich Brooks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in their prime, Oregon was not an elite defensive team, but their offense made up for the defensive woes the Ducks faced. Things were decent with Nick Alliotti as their defensive coordinator, who was at least able to make the best of it, but after he retired, it went downhill. Again, Oregon kept it in family by promoting Don Pellum from Linebackers coach. But after Marcus Mariota left, the Ducks struggled on defense, and their offense couldn't sustain consistency, which was explained perfectly in the Alamo Bowl, where the Ducks blew a 31-0 halftime lead after losing talented QB Vernon Adams to injury to lose the game 34-31, where the team had to hold on for dear life and couldn't. Pellum was demoted and in came Brady Hoke, the former Michigan coach serving as a coordinator for the first time. Unfortunately, a lack of talent combined with a defensive scheme change helped led the Ducks to their worst season since 1991.  That was not an issue with Chip but more on Helfrich.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why Mark Helfrich was fired.  He couldn't grow the program like Chip Kelly had.  The defensive players they brought in weren't as good as advertised and their highly-rated QB recruits didn't pan out, leading to using talented transfers Vernon Adams and Dakota Prukop to come along.  For the first time since Mariota left, the Ducks appear to have the QB of the future in Justin Herbert, who showed lots of potential as a true freshman, but with a porous defense and young offensive line, the Ducks couldn't overcome the lousy defense to win.  And like Mariota, Justin Herbert is a diamond in the rough, from Sheldon High School and not highly recruited.  Unfortunately, the Ducks weren't lucky like that on the defensive side.  In the end, that's what cost Helfrich the job. Would I given Helfrich one more chance?  Sure I would’ve.  Is it surprising the Ducks didn't?  Of course not.  The cracks were showing, and unfortunately, they aren’t likely to get better now.  So where does Oregon go from here?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The Ducks are in uncharted territory now. The basketball team dealt with this when Ernie Kent got fired after a long run. The Ducks thought they could throw money at big-time coaches, but that failed miserably and they were laughed at when they finally made their decision to hire Creighton head coach Dana Altman. Fortunately, the Ducks were lucky to get him, as he’s done a great job with the basketball squad. So with that in mind, Oregon shouldn’t have too high of expectations with their coaching search. Les Miles? Highly unlikely to come out west. Lane Kiffin? I’d be embarrassed to give him another coaching opportunity. PJ Fleck from Western Michigan? Perhaps but I don’t see it happening. Chip Kelly? That’s a pipe dream. Will they keep their offense the same? Will they bring someone with defensive skills? One things for sure, there are rough waters upon the horizon and it’s not going to get fixed overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Thirteen Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's officially rivalry week, where the Civil War and the Battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe is in full effect, along with a slew of other important games, including Michigan-Ohio State, Colorado-Utah and Alabama-Auburn.  If you're not ready for college football this week, then you shouldn't be watching football at all.  Conference champion bids on the line today in an exciting week for college football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jim-harbaugh.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Jim Harbaugh&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Jim Harbaugh breaking his headset, and he looks less intimidating with those glasses&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I have seen both sides of college football rivalries.  On the one hand, Oregon hasn't lost the Civil War since 2007, throughly dominating the Beavers in the process.  But I know what it's like to be the Beavers, as Minnesota hasn't won Paul Bunyan's Axe since 2003, as Wisconsin has clearly dominated the series.  So safe to say, I know both the good and the bad in rivalry games.  Will this be the year the Gophers chop down the goal post with the Axe, something I've never seen before?  Will Oregon maintain its dominance against Oregon State, with this being their last game in an otherwise disappointing season?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Playing against the Big West champion Wisconsin wasn't going to be easy by any means, and Minnesota, time and time again, while playing against competitive teams, start off well enough but lose steam in the second half.  And this is exactly what happened to the Gophers today.  Mitch Leidner looked brilliant in the first half, his best performance of the season, leading the Gophers to a 17-7 lead.  The second half, not so much, as Mitch Leidner ended up throwing four interceptions in a 31-17 loss (again) to Wisconsin.  Pretty much what I expected from Mitch Leidner and the Gophers.  The regular season's over; they finished 8-4, which is exactly what I predicted from them, but the Big Ten West was stronger than expected, which got them in fourth place.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Civil War, this year featuring two losing teams, had nothing but pride on the line.  Oregon came in as the favorite by 3, but on the road against an Oregon State team that can run the ball consistently, Oregon had their hands full with Ryan Nall at the helm, who had his coming out party against the Ducks last year.  And scoring four touchdowns, the Beavers finally beat Oregon in the Civil War.  A perfect ending to a bad season from the Ducks, who I thought would still be a winning team at 9-3, but their defense was far worse than advertised.  Oregon's season is over, and now for the big question, will Mark Helfrich still be the head coach?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Big Game for the playoff hunt was of course, Michigan at Ohio State, and the game matched the hype, as the two teams went back and forth, and for the first time in the series, the game went into overtime.  But Ohio State ended up on top, winning 30-27 in double OT.  But with Ohio State's win, now comes the big question?  Does Ohio State, with just one loss to Penn State, get into the playoffs with Penn State, not Ohio State, winning the Big Ten East by virtue of giving the Buckeyes their only loss?  And if so, does the Big Ten title winner also make it to the Playoffs?  Wisconsin and Penn State are both ranked in the top 8 right now and have only two losses on the year.  Alabama and Clemson are locks to return assuming they win their conference champion, and Washington, should they win the Pac-12 title, would also have only one loss.  I would have to believe at this point that the Big Ten will have two teams.  Washington, unfortunately, didn't play a strong schedule, and that will cost them (assuming they win the Pac-12 title) along with the good old East Coast Bias.  Had they beaten USC, it would be a different story.  This also means Oklahoma is out of the race. That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson, Washington, Wisconsin and Penn State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/pitt-syracuse.JPG&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Pitt-Syracuse&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Defenses need not apply with Pitt vs. Syracuse&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;As previously suspected, Texas really wanted Charlie Strong fired and they did.  Record aside, he never had a chance to succeed at Texas.  What a shame.  As for the Texas Longhorns, Houston head coach Tom Herman has agreed to take over.  A very logical choice for Texas. --- Speaking of coaching vacancies, Ed Orgeron was promoted as head coach for LSU, absolutely the right decision for LSU.  USC made a mistake choosing Steve Sarkisian over then interim Ed Orgeron, and he's a fighter, which LSU clearly proved after firing Les Miles. --- Pittsburgh and Syracuse had an extreme shoot-out, with Pitt winning 76-61, setting a record for the most points in a game between two teams.  Speaking of Pitt, they've beaten two of the six teams still with a shot at the playoffs, Clemson and Penn State.  --- Navy also reached to 70 point club today, with a 75-31 win over SMU. --- Now that the regular season's over, my pick for the Heisman is still Louisville QB Lamar Jackson, despite Louisville's late season slump; they lost to instate rival Kentucky 41-38.  I can't think of anyone else more deserving.  --- Congrats to Colorado, who went from winning just five games the past three years to winning the Pac-12 South with a 10-2 regular season record.  Remarkable turnaround from a program who really needed it.  Mike MacIntyre deserves to be the national coach of the year for this stunning turnaround.  And they kept USC out of the Pac-12 title game.  A Double Winner in my book. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan (-3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penn State (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colorado (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma State (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Twelve Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The season's almost over, and there's no margin for error when it comes to finishing the season strong and ending the year on a positive note.  Oregon's not going to make a bowl, but they have two games left to try to pick up the pieces and finish the year on a positive note.  For Mark Helfrich, that could make the difference between remaining as head coach or not.  For the Golden Gophers, seven wins is not enough, eight would be better.  And the playoff race is down to the final stretch, and those who lose will face elimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/darren-carrington.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Darren Carrington&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;By the slimest of margins, Darren Carrington's touchdown pushed Oregon to victory&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oregon faced off against Utah, bringing back memories of their last trip to Salt Lake City two years ago, memorable for two reasons.  First was the ridiculous and infamous Kaelin Clay fumble just BEFORE he crossed the goal line, which Oregon recovered and ran a convoy to a touchdown while Utah was celebrating their 'touchdown.'  That is something I'll never forget.  Second was the unfortunate injury to Pharaoh Brown, who returns to Salt Lake City for the first time since.  Unfortunately, Oregon has had a bad season, while Utah is ranked #12 and has an outside shot of winning the Pac-12 title.  But there's a reason they play the game, and Oregon had its best defensive performance of the year, playing with their hearts, as they managed to hold Utah to just 28 points.  And needing something to go their way, Justin Herbert completed an improbable pass to Darren Carrington, who just managed to get his foot inbounds for an acrobatic catch to get the improbable win, a stunner to say the least.  Perhaps this will get Mark Helfrich one more chance, which I believe he deserves.  Next week is Oregon's last game of the season, but it's always an entertaining matchup when it's the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's Senior Day for Minnesota, and on a chilly November afternoon, its their last home game of the year against the most bizarre of teams, Northwestern.  The Wildcats started the year on an awful note, losing to Western Michigan and Illinois State, but recovered in Big Ten play, beating Iowa.  Of course, this means it will be Mitch Leidner's last home game for the Gophers.  Leidner has been a decent quarterback, but too much inconsistency in the passing game kept Leidner from reaching the next level.  Fortunately, Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks figure to be back next year (assuming neither one goes to the NFL...), and they have been the bread and butter for the Gophers this year, along with their defense.  As for Northwestern, their offense never got comfortable against Minnesota's pressure, with multiple sacks and turnovers.  The Gophers took a while to get their offense going (aside from a perfect opening drive) as Mitch Leidner finally threw a touchdown pass (his first in seven weeks).  The Gophers put together a good performance against Northwestern, and have reached eight wins for the season.  They're not going to make it to the Big Ten title game, but Minnesota has played better this year than last (although their schedule this season was far easier than last year's gauntlet).  The final game of the regular season, a battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe, as I would love to see the Gophers win it just once.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Thursday night proved to be big for the playoff race, as Louisville got blown out by Houston, probably ending their hopes.  It's hard to say what the race would've been like had Houston not lost to Navy and (especially) SMU, with two big wins against Oklahoma and now Louisville.  Clemson is heading to the ACC Title game against whoever wins the ACC's other division (Virginia Tech?), so a win in the ACC title game would put them back in the playoffs.  Ohio State barely got by Michigan State, 17-16, and Michigan needed a good fourth quarter to put Indiana away, but next week the Wolverines and Buckeyes face off in what could determine who wins the Big Ten.  But Penn State still has a shot at crashing that party.  Watch out... That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Ohio State, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Wisconsin, Penn State and Oklahoma.  Penn State could make it to the Big Ten title game over both Ohio State and Michigan (assuming they beat Michigan State) if Ohio State beats Michigan.  Watch out...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sc-state.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joe Thomas Sr.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;55 years young walk-on Joe Thomas Sr. getting hoisted by his young teammates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;South Carolina State made history today as 55-years-young Joe Thomas Sr. (whose son plays for the Green Bay Packers), became the oldest player to play in a Division I college football game.  Proof that it's never too late to play.  Kudos for Joe Thomas Sr. --- At the beginning of the season, who would've thought that Washington State vs. Colorado could both be playing with the Pac-12 championship on the line?  Colorado has been in the dumps for a while but has finally found a way out, while Washington State finally found a defense as good as its Air Raid offense.  Kudos for both of them, but more for Colorado, who won 38-24.  Colorado is a win away from making the Pac-12 Title game.  As for Mike Leach, I still don't like him though he's good at what he does. --- Remember when Texas was ranked in the Top Ten earlier this year after beating Notre Dame?  How times have changed.  Notre Dame was not very good, and now that Texas just lost today to Kansas (for the first time since 1938), there's a lot of reasons to be upset in Texas.  Word around town is that they really want to fire Charlie Strong.  Good coach with values, but Texas has ridiculously high standards, he was never going to succeed with all the pressure. ---  LSU running back Leonard Fournette wasn't supposed to play today against Florida due to injury, but after a brawl before the game, he asked to be put in.  Toughness aside, it's probably not the best idea to be inspired by a feud. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penn State(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma State(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colorado (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Eleven Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's survival week in Week 11 for the Oregon Ducks, who played against Stanford to have one last shot at turning around their season and making a bowl game, which seemed like a forgone conclusion at the beginning of the season.  For Minnesota, it's the start of Minnesota's true challenges to determine their worth in the Big Ten West, heading to Nebraska to see if they still have an outside shot of winning the West.  How well would this turn out for each team?  How would the playoff chase take shape, in what turned out to be a crazy Playoff Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/pharaoh-brown.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Pharaoh Brown&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Pharaoh Brown: The Definition of Tough&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oregon faced Stanford, who's had a bit of a down season compared to years past, but finds themselves healthy at the right time as Christian McCaffrey, battling some injuries, looked ready to avenge Stanford's only Pac-12 loss last year against Oregon.  And with Oregon's defense being so terrible and their offensive line banged up and full of freshmen, Stanford easily won 52-27.  It was their last home game for the season, as their last two games will be at the road against Utah and Oregon State, with no bowl game for Oregon.  One nice thing to see was TE Pharaoh Brown in his last game at Autzen Stadium being honored on Senior Day before the game.  Pharaoh Brown has come a long way from his gruesome leg injury two seasons ago at Utah.  It's a miracle that not only has he recovered from nearly having his leg amputated, but has contributed to about the same level of play that he had before the injury.  Next week, Pharaoh Brown and the Ducks head back to Utah for the first time, which will surely be an emotional game for Brown.  The good news for the Ducks: Basketball season begins with the Ducks highest preseason ranking ever at #5.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Gophers faced their toughest opponent of the season so far in a rare Big Ten evening matchup against Nebraska.  The Cornhuskers, who have lost their last two games after an unbeaten start (albeit against Ohio State and Wisconsin), still have a shot at the Big Ten West title.  Minnesota was obviously the underdogs, in a tough environment, and for the most part, they hung tough, but like the Penn State game, Minnesota could not produce in the second half, after having a 17-10 halftime lead.  In the end, Nebraska won 24-17, as Tommy Armstrong led the way for the Cornhuskers, accounting for most of their offense.  A typical performance for Mitch Leidner, who showed his typical good moments and bad moments, an interception on the last drive sealed the win for Nebraska.  The Gophers have some talent, but lack the umph to get them to the next step.  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After Texas A&amp;amp;M took a bow, Washington entered in the top four where it originally belonged.  But they blew an opportunity to stay there (or go higher), getting stunned by the Cheaters.  It isn't that shocking considering how easy Washington's schedule has been up to this point, but still stunning nonetheless.  Even more shocking and less expected was Clemson, who lost to Pittsburgh at home, with Pitt winning it with a field goal at the end of the game.  Clemson won a bunch of close games, but their luck ran out tonight.  And to top it off, Michigan also lost, with Iowa stunning them with a field goal in a 14-13 upset.  With the way the season's going, Michigan, Washington and Clemson are still alive in the playoff hunt, but one thing is clear; Alabama is clearly the best team in the country and the odds-on favorite to repeat as National Champions; the only major unbeaten team left of the bunch (Western Michigan is unbeaten as well but not a major contender).  Of course, their Iron Bowl rival Auburn lost to Georgia, eliminating them from the chase. That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Ohio State, Louisville, Wisconsin and Oklahoma.  The final three teams have been added to the list but the former six are the best shots at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/d9219de64719067415526bb881de5822.gif&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Kansas&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;It's Karma Chameleon Time for Kansas WR LaQuvionte Gonzalez&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;In what might be the funniest trick play I've ever seen, Kansas WR LaQuvionte Gonzalez laid down in the endzone on a kickoff return in an attempt to camouflage in the blue field, only to get up and catch a backwards lateral from kick returner Steven Sims Jr. for a 29 yard gain. --- Division III powerhouse Mount Union saw their 112 game regular season winning streak end today against John Carroll, losing 31-28.  The streak, which began in 2005, stands as one of two regular season losses for Mount Union, as they had previously gone 222-1 since 1994, the last season they didn't win their conference championship.  Very impressive, no matter the level of competition. --- Sad story out of Florida International, as their starting TE Jonnu Smith suffered multiple burns on his body, allegedly from his girlfriend pouring water on him in a fight.  I really hate stories like this, I hope he has a speedy recovery and can play again.  His career at FIU is over, but he's listed as a potential NFL prospect.  --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State (+3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson (-2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (-3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penn State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma State (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Thank You Intolerant Republicans for Ruining our Country</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thank you Intolerant Republicans for ruining the country I used to think was fair and open minded.  Thanks to your extreme intolerance, you all have turned our country into a cesspool of fear, hate and bigotry.  Anyone with a differing view from you Intolerant Republicans is deemed problematic, awful and un-American.  Now that America has voted Dictator Donald Trump as President, I no longer feel safe or welcomed by the Federal Government.  As such, this will be my last political post, which is fine because Dictator Trump has completely ruined the country as we know it.  I am done with believing the Government will ever work for all Americans.  Extremism is the problem, not the solution, and anyone who thinks this type of change is good for us is biased and ignorant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/barack-obama.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Barack Obama&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Barack Obama will be my President, Dictator Trump is not my President and will never be my President&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Some people call it change:  I call it intolerance.  The people who voted for Dictator Trump are the same people who adamantly refused to work with President Obama or consider him their President.  To these people, it was all about race.  Everything is a race issue with them, and having an African American President was unacceptable to them.  Their attacks on him were extremely personal and racist to boot.  From Day One, Republicans in Congress refused to work with Obama, as they made it their mission to make him a one-term president (which failed), imply that his heritage disqualified him (which Dictator Trump led that racist accusation) and obstruct everything Obama had to offer, clearly believing the country was better off horrible than enacting one of his ideas for him to take credit.  Obama reached out to them; they said no, and their supporters were happy with that because they expect things their way and now.  They treated him like shit, called him ‘un-American’ simply for not having the same view as them and refused to believe the obvious facts that he was a Christian from Hawaii, because according to them, if he has a Muslim name, he must be a Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, these intolerant Republicans don’t care about what anyone else thinks.  They have no problem expressing their “First Amendment” rights, but anyone else that does to argue against them apparently don’t have the same rights.  They’ll discredit them, call them un-American, tell them to leave, and find new and inventive ways to keep their voices from being heard, whether it’s voter suppression or claiming the people actually have a say in the vote for Supreme Court Justice.  What America needs is for all voices to be heard.  But the Intolerant Republicans only want their voice to be heard, and expect everyone else to follow them.  It’s their way or the highway.  Again, it’s not real change; it’s the other side wanting their beliefs and ignore everyone else’s.  Real change actually fixes problem.  Bad change simply changes the burden from one half to the other.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Being a Jewish minority, I can no longer feel safe due to these intolerant Republicans who assume or expect me to be Christian.  It's sickening enough for people to wish me a Merry Christmas because I look like them.  Religion is not skin-color based and these Intolerant Republicans hate it when people say Happy Holidays, ignorant to the fact that people in the United States have different beliefs and religions.  It's even worse to know those who genuinely hate Jews are all of the sudden more empowered to 'take their country back' from the minorities.  After all, these Ignorant Republicans only get mad when minorities do something wrong.  A white man killing two cops?  Not a problem for them, that guy has gun rights.   A black man killing two cops?  He must be a cop-killer, a gangster and part of Black Lives Matter, a racist organization that promotes violence against cops (it doesn't).   It’s all about white power to them and it disgusts me that this type of behavior is not only not discouraged by them, but rewarded.  Bullying is not something that should be rewarded.  I would get fired by my job, like millions of honest Americans, for saying the racist crap Dictator Trump said during his campaign.  It's pathetic that he had to use this to get attention, as he didn't really need it to begin with.  How can I trust someone who has belittled, insulted and bad-mouth most of America simply to win a race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the Intolerant Republicans out there, I’m just a young Liberal who hates white people for supporting minorities and Jewish, so I must be greedy with money and not a Christian, and since Anthony Weiner is a pervert, I must be a pervert too because I'm Jewish.  I’m a perfectly normal human being who's a model citizen, not greedy nor a pervert.  But the intolerant people who rule this country don’t care what ideas I’d bring to the table; they just see me as a stereotype.  They don’t care about any of the Liberal ideas that mixed with Conservative ideas would actually help this country heal together.  Rather, they’ve started a dangerous back and forth game of who goes the lowest and destroys the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, thank you Intolerant Republicans for ruining this country.  With complete control, 100% of everything bad that happens to us, and it will be really bad, will be all on your shoulders.  Republicans are the reason our country is in ruins.  True, there are some decent Republicans; Ohio Governor John Kasich, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and former Secretary of State Colin Powell (who btw did the same thing as Hillary Clinton with those stupid emails) are example of Republicans who give a damn, but the majority hate anyone who opposes them.  They make their opinions before their opponents actually pass their laws, and now that they have all the control to do what they want, they will have to own up to their stupid ideas.  They won't be able to blame Obama, although they will try their damn hardest to blame him for everything like they have been before.  They'll live in their fantasy world where everything they do is right and everything everyone else thinks is wrong.  They want to go to war, they got one, but this is not over and Intolerant Republicans are the problem with this country, not the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Ten Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's 'I Hate USC' week as the Oregon Ducks head down to SoCal for the first time since 2012.  I really hate USC, and I make it no secret, but you can read all about that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2015/11/21/usc-my-anti-christ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  But there are more important things than bashing all things USC.  The Gophers played Purdue and with the official playoff rankings out, the chase really begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/western-michigan.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Western Michigan&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Western Michigan QB Zach Terrell&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The Gophers hosted Purdue, a team that's been at the bottom of the pole the past few years but has nothing to lose.  Their style of play, more pass-heavy than the traditional Big Ten team makes Purdue a potentially sneaky team.  And in the first half, Purdue kept it close, taking the lead just before the half after a dumb interception from Mitch Leidner.  But the second half was a different story, as Rodney Smith led the way on the ground and the Gophers defense took over, winning 44-31.  Shannon Brooks was injured and not much is known why, or for how long.  They need him back to complement Rodney Smith, as the schedule gets tougher for the last three games: Nebraska, Northwestern and rival Wisconsin.  The Gophers have won four straight and have surpassed their win total last year, but the meat of their schedule is now.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;That leads into the game against the Cheaters.  Of course, Oregon hasn't been themselves this year and their defense is young and broken.  But perhaps an upset is in the books.  Unfortunately, that was not the case as the Cheaters won 45-20.  Not much to say here, but we can solace in the fact that the Cheaters are still overrated and unworthy of the hype.  They were blown out by Alabama, blown out by Stanford, and most importantly, lost a close game to Utah, the latter which will probably keep them out of the Pac-12 title game.  So the Cheaters are still an overrated piece of crap.  Next up for Oregon, the only other dominant team in the Pac-12 North up until this year; Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The official College Football Playoff Rankings have begun, and surprise surprise, Texas A&amp;amp;M finds itself ranked ahead of Washington.  First ranking aside, another sign of SEC-bias.  But obviously, it's the final ranking that matters.  But they won't be ranked fourth in the next poll, they lost to Mississippi State, losing their QB Trevor Knight in the process.  That's what we call a big jinx.  Also of note is Clemson jumping ahead of Michigan.  With wins against Louisville and Florida State, Clemson has definitely had a tougher schedule to this point.  As Baylor, Texas A&amp;amp;M and Nebraska lost, we can eliminate them.  That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Ohio State, Louisville, Auburn, Wisconsin and Oklahoma.  The final three teams have been added to the list but the former six are the best shots at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sf27.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Sam Foltz&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Proof that kindness in humanity still exists, courtesy of Ohio State.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;Baylor was completely obliterated against TCU.  Thank god, I've never liked Baylor and their imitation high speed offense.  And unlike Oregon, who made two national title games this decade, Baylor couldn't win the big game. Goodbye Baylor.  --- Washington State is now ranked and won big against Arizona, 69-7.  Who knows how high they'd be ranked if not for their loss to Eastern Washington.  But much kudos to them.  And they're still unbeaten in conference play.  If they keep up the pace, they could finally get the ESPN GameDay crew to come to Pullman, as the Apple Cup is at Pullman this year. --- I've always enjoyed the smaller schools, so I got my eye on Western Michigan, as the only unbeaten team left amongst the non-major conference schools.  They are clearly the second best team in the state of Michigan, as Michigan State lost again to Illinois.  How did the Spartans fall so far off the face of the planet?  But Western Michigan, who beat Northwestern in the first game of the season and beat Illinois as well, two more Big Ten opponents than Michigan State has beaten, has a shot to finish unbeaten.  We'll see what happens. --- Hearing about the death of Nebraska punter Sam Foltz and all the tributes their opponents have given them reminds me of how great humanity can be.  Mike Riley is absolutely the right coach for Nebraska and despite his mistakes in the past, is man enough to admit his errors and make things right. It should be noted that this was the only nice thing Ohio State did against Nebraska; they blew them out of the water, 62-3. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auburn (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penn State (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oklahoma (NR)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>One week in the Lakers Season - The 2016 Edition</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote about the Lakers season one week into the year, with much chagrin, as the Lakers took a while to win.  This season is a completely different story.  Would I call them a playoff team at this point?  Of course not, but there's a much different vibe this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jordan-clarkson.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Jordan Clarkson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Jordan Clarkson's been a big steal for the Lakers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I would define the Lakers right now as a group of young ducklings.  Last season, it was all about Kobe's farewell show.  Now, it's more about the chase into seeing which of the young Lakers develops to be the next great one.  That to me is a good reason to watch these Lakers.  I don't have a favorite player, but rather a nice group of players that can mold into my favorite.  Right now, the Lakers are 2-3, having beating two of my least favorite players (and former teammates), James Harden (with Houston) and Dwight Howard (now with Atlanta).  Their win in Atlanta was impressive as road games, especially the last of four straight road games, coming back from a deficit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest questions of the Lakers drafting D'Angelo Russell last year was the development of equally talented guard Jordan Clarkson.  Fortunately, new coach Luke Walton found the perfect way to utilize him, as the team's sixth man.  Even better, Clarkson has accepted that role with good results so far.  The type of player the Lakers need.  I was surprised when I first learned of this, especially with Nick Young now the starting shooting guard.  There were doubts he'd even make the roster.  But it's easy to say his ex-girlfriend Izzy Azalea (ugh) was killing his career.  At the moment, it's been a good call, and Nick Young has improved, especially on the defensive end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img src=&quot;/img/larry-nance-jr.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Larry Nance Jr.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;h4&gt;Larry Nance Jr. can dunk!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight the Lakers return home to host the Golden State Warriors, now with Kevin Durant, wearing their throwback 1986-1987 champion Lakers jerseys.  Though the Warriors are obviously the better team right now, the Lakers are at home and Golden State had a hard fought matchup against Durant's former team.  But the Lakers did beat the Warriors in their last regular season game, rather convincingly.  Never say never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lakers have a nice future ahead of them.  They've brought in some nice young players: D'Angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson and Julius Randle.  They have nice veteran leaders in Luol Deng and Lou Williams.  Their bench is filled with energetic players, from the aforementioned Clarkson and Williams to Larry Nance Jr., whose dunking abilities perfectly describes his play.  They're missing a bonafide star, but Russell's in his second year and much improved from his rookie year when he was stuck with Kobe.  Brandon Ingram is a rookie and it will take him time.  We'll see if Randle or Clarkson can become All-Star's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Nine Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week Nine featured two decent matchups on my end.  For the Gophers, it was the week to clinch bowl eligibility.  For Oregon, it was another week to end their hideous skid.  How did Week Nine play out?  Read here for my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/shannon-brooks.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Shannon Brooks&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Shannon Brooks&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Two seasons ago, when Minnesota made its first New Year's Day bowl since 1962, the Gophers were upset by Illinois, a lowlight for that season.  This year, the Gophers needed not to repeat that game.  And thankfully, the banged-up Fighting Illini were no match for the Gophers ground game and their defense shined.  Illinois had two key turnovers in the first half leading to both Minnesota touchdowns as the Gophers easily won 40-17. Illinois was down to their third-string freshman QB Jeff George Jr. (son of infamous NFL QB Jeff George).  Their top receiver, Malik Turner got hurt in the first quarter from an unfortunate hit from safety Duke McGhee, who was ejected for targeting.  With a particular windy day, the Gophers ground game made it easy for them, as the Gophers are now bowl eligible at 6-2.  But the season's not over and they still have a shot at the Big Ten West title, which definitely won't come easy with their last three games against Nebraska, Northwestern and Wisconsin.  Next up, Purdue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oregon desparately needed a win against Arizona State, whom Oregon went through drastic measures to keep the Sun Devils from stealing their signs (much like Washington State did against them last week).  Also notable were Arizona States &quot;Desert Chrome&quot; uniforms, which look stylish, much different from their same-color-scheme-as-Minnesota's jerseys.  Thankfully, the Ducks finally won a game, their first Pac-12 win of the season, winning 54-35.  One thing for certain is that Justin Herbert, despite looking like a thirteen year old (he's 18, a true freshman) is legit.  His shocking meteoric rise from afterthought to being the first true freshman to start for the Ducks since Chris Miller in 1983 is quite astonishing considering he wasn't highly recruited, and from nearby Sheldon High School, a hometown kid.  What's not to love about Justin Herbert.  He threw for 489 passing yards today (tying a team record with Bill Musgrave) with 4 touchdowns.  Impressive, especially as a true freshman.  Hopefully, the Ducks will turn around their season now, but it won't be easy.  Next up, the worst school in the country, the University of Spoiled Cheaters.  God I hate them so much!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Big XII's playoff chances took a huge hit today as West Virginia lost at Oklahoma State.  Their chances were slim to begin with, but at this point, the Big XII is going to need help to get back into the Playoffs.  Even worse was the fact that Baylor lost as well, being upset by Texas in the last minute 35-34.  I'm glad Baylor lost, especially with all the sexual assaults Art Briles ignored as coach, recent reports indicate he failed to report at least one sexual assault case he knew about.  And he claims he didn't deserve to be fired.  Yes he did!  But at this point, Oklahoma is the only unbeaten Big XII team in conference play, but with two non-conference losses against Ohio State and Houston (who lost last week to SMU of all teams), that makes their challenge more daunting.  As I'm obligated to include one Big XII team, I'm not ready to eliminate Baylor from my list.  But it's a long shot.  Nebraska also lost for the first time this season against Wisconsin, who, you can never count out.  With that said, they need to make it to the Big Ten title game to be considered for a playoff berth.  That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Ohio State, Texas A&amp;amp;M, Louisville, Nebraska, Baylor, and Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;The Legend of Justin Herbert continues.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;Washington finally faced a significant test as they visited Utah in a hard fought 31-24 victory, with Washington winning the game on a punt return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.  If Lamar Jackson doesn't win the Heisman Trophy for some reason, Washington QB Jake Browning should win it.  He's been quite good this season for the Huskies.  I still don't like the Huskies but the Pac-12 needs someone in the Playoffs and they're the only hope at this point.  I'd rather see them in then two SEC teams, to say the least. --- Speaking of Lamar Jackson, Louisville needed a last-minute touchdown from him to beat Virginia, 32-25.  Not the type of performance you want if the Playoffs are their goal. ---  The most disappointing team this season is thankfully not Oregon, but rather their marquee non-conference matchup from last year, Michigan State, who's lost six in a row after starting the season 2-0.  What in the world happened to the Spartans? --- Clearly, no one is benefiting from Northwestern's strange season more than unbeaten Western Michigan.  The Broncos aren't going to play in the Playoffs even if they are unbeaten but they can still make a New Year's Six Bowl.  Fortunately, that task just got easier after Boise State got upset by Wyoming, a 30-28 win by the Cowboys, who won it with a safety in the last minute.  Of course, Western Michigan needs to remain unbeaten and make it in the Top 15 for consideration.  Right now, they're ranked 20th.  I love a good underdog story. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nebraska (-2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Today marks the one year anniversary to my launch of Adam’s Blog.  It's come a long way from its humble roots, going through my major redesign in April.  So to honor my blog, here's a brief history of my blog and how I wound up getting here, along with some of my favorite posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Happy Birthday!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my blog using JSON through my Express backed main website.   Not the best way to do a blog, but still got me through as I continued to fine tune my developing skills.  Eventually, I made the decision to break off from my Express backed main website and used a Jekyll powered blog branching off my website, which gave me much more flexibility in my blog pages themselves.  I officially relaunched blog.bodiewebdesign.com on May 4th.  I had hoped for a smooth launch, but just before I was ready to move over, the breaking news of degenerate &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/05/03/ted-cruz-the-definition-of-pathetic&quot;&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt; dropping out of the Presidential race, which I had to put a blog about.  I was working on a blog post on him, which I wanted to release afterwards, but needed to post on that disgusting turd.  And special thanks to my sister Jenn for reminding me of that booger pic to use.  Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you'll see from reading my blog, my two favorite subjects are sports, particularly football and basketball, and unfortunately, politics.  This political cycle has been awful, but has given me an opportunity to express my displeasure in &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/01/31/dumb-and-dumber-why-the-top-republican-presidental-candidates-suck-at-math&quot;&gt;Dumb and Dumber&lt;/a&gt;, a.k.a. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.  Hopefully that stops after the election.  I hate those two passionately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upgrading to Jekyll gave me more flexibility in my posts.  One post I'm particularly proud of is my expose on Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe’s ridiculous theories on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/05/08/climate-change-and-snow&quot;&gt;global warming&lt;/a&gt;, as I was able to add a D3 based graph showcasing Snow levels throughout the years to debunk Inhofe's stupid beliefs.  It gave me an opportunity to try a new JavaScript library, which is always fun to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my blogging skills itself, I feel it has helped me expressed myself through different channels.  I admit, it doesn't come easy for me to speak up, but writing my thoughts allows me to be more elegant and graceful than I have been in a long time.  One particular thing I've enjoyed is my live blogging posts.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/basketball/2016/04/13/mamba-day-and-everyones-celebrating&quot;&gt;Kobe Bryant's&lt;/a&gt; last game and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/basketball/2016/06/23/nba-draft-the-future-is-now&quot;&gt;NBA Draft&lt;/a&gt; were my favorites.  Live blogging the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/09/26/liar-liar-pant-is-on-fire&quot;&gt;first Presidential debate&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, was a letdown for me.  Some things are better to blog than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most important blog post I made was &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/08/08/my-pledge&quot;&gt;my pledge&lt;/a&gt; from August.  It's been two months and I still haven't verbally used that Idiot's name.  It's important to live in a free country and that Idiot is downright pathetic and unpatriotic.  As you'll see, plenty of posts about him and his awful ways.  I'm proud of the commitment I've made and I'm especially proud to have voted for Hillary Clinton this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than anything, my blog gives me another channel to showcase my creativity.  Some of my posts are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/politics/2016/06/12/three-little-words&quot;&gt;serious&lt;/a&gt; while others are downright &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2016/10/10/why-i-should-be-the-next-starting-quarterback-of-the-cleveland-browns&quot;&gt;silly&lt;/a&gt;.  Whatever the case may be, I enjoy my work and am proud of it as well.  Here's to another year of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
