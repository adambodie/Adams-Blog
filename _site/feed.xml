        <title>Enough is Enough</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Enough is enough.  For so long, our country has turned a blind eye on racism, proclaiming that it&#39;s not a big deal like it used to be, just because of Civil Rights and the elimination of Jim Crow laws.  But recent events, particularly the deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas have shown just how horrific racism in the United States really is.  Is there a coincidence that this is happening now at this current time?  Of course not.  This is a by-product of the anger and race baiting politics that Donald Trump has shoved down America&#39;s throats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ferguson-free-hug.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hugs for everyone&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;This is what America&#39;s all about...Coming together.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Listen to Donald Trump speak.  Read between the lines with his stupid tweets.  Whatever the case be, Donald Trump is ANGRY.  He claims he wants to make America great again, but all he does is pit people against one another.  This type of hate-filled angst causes people to be angry and lack the ability to control their emotions.  A level-headed person is far more likely to make rational decisions than angry people whose emotions take control.  We don&#39;t need to hear the thoughts of the angry few.  Most people aren&#39;t like that.  And those who are angry with violent tendencies are often the ones who want to cause physical and mental harm to us.  This has been brewing for years with the racist minority openly complaining about Obama and his worldview.  The racists blame Obama for everything wrong, yet it&#39;s them who are making things worse.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This happened in Baton Rouge, where Alton Sterling was shot dead by police multiple times while he was pinned to the ground by two officers.  A man who didn&#39;t deserve to die, yet too many times in these instances, regardless of race, the Officers always try to pin the victim as a &#39;criminal&#39; for past convictions.  Doesn&#39;t matter.  Regardless of whether there was an altercation or not, it&#39;s not reasonable to shoot a man in the chest at point blank range if you have him pinned to the ground.  Clearly, hate for another leads to mistrust and violence.  The Police often blame those they kill as bad guys while the victims and their loved ones proclaim the Police and others as being overly aggressive due to their appearance.  Police hide behind their badge to justify their actions, rarely, if ever facing conviction for killing innocent people.  Black people often feel targeted for their skin color and sometimes act irrationally due to false accusations.  This hate needs will never stop while others on the sidelines encourage others to act by making these things solely a race issue.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Too often people look solely at people&#39;s skin color and make judgments about them.  Some of it is blatant, while some of it is subconscious.  Some people may not realize it, but they are too focused on appearances when judging people.  This was clearly shown in the death of Philando Castile, who was pulled over in Falcon Heights, Minnesota for a &#39;broken tail-light.&#39;  According to his girlfriend, who was seating next to him in the car, the Officer asked for license and registration (which is standard anytime someone gets pulled over, I know from personal experience), but then told him not to move the moment Philando mentioned having a gun.  No one who would want to shoot an Officer would openly tell them they&#39;re armed, but something must have clicked in the Officer&#39;s head, as suddenly he judged Philando Castile as &#39;a black man with a gun, he must be a gangster that wants to kill me,&#39; rather than a complex human being who, contrary to those negative stereotypes, never had any trouble with the law.  This Officer had hate filled in his heart for whatever reason, and it led him to shoot Philando four times dead, while his girlfriend watched and cried in horror and recorded the aftermath.  No one deserves to die, especially over a &#39;broken tail-light.&#39;  Even worse, the Officer and his backup showed no compassion for him or his girlfriend and 4 year old daughter in the car.  Instead, they watched him die, holding the gun pointed at him and arrested her.  Watching this video, it saddens me and only further supports my point.  The Officer was screaming, while the woman was shockingly calm yet upset.  That&#39;s not rational, that&#39;s anger for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Yet instead of trying to heal the wounds, others loudly complain about the &#39;other side&#39; playing the blame game.  These people will try to blame everyone else except the person who actually committed the crime.  They&#39;ll make them look like victims of the Government&#39;s views on society.  This is not a fantasy world, and only encourages more anger from those who feel like they&#39;re being targeted.  This is exactly what happened in Dallas, where Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25 year old African American and former Army reservist, angry with police officers for killing Alton and Philando (among others), set out to kill as many White police officers as he could.  Perhaps if someone had calmed him down and reminded him that most people were upset like he was and violence wasn&#39;t the answer, this may not have happened.  Instead, we had plenty of voices who have and continue to blame Blacks for their own deaths.  They get what they deserve.  They&#39;re only interested in killing cops.  These are the voices of the racist extremists that overshadow the compassionate majority.  To him, his actions were justified by the minority, which led him to murdering cops in anger.  None of this is okay for most, yet the hate filled few openly play race wars and hate games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Joe Walsh decided to delete this tweet. So let&amp;#39;s all retweet it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BY03pLmTyp&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/BY03pLmTyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Matthew Rosenberg (@AllMattNYT) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AllMattNYT/status/751281426784329728&quot;&gt;July 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As I read about the deaths in Dallas, it disgusts me that some blame the African American&#39;s and even Obama himself for all of this mess.  It&#39;s downright racist to believe that somehow because Obama is black, that he somehow supports a black man killing multiple police officers.  Obama referred to the shooting as a “vicious, calculated, despicable attack.”  Yet racist people like former congressman Joe Walsh, congressman Steve King, and media joke Sarah Palin don&#39;t even bother to listen to a single word he says.  I doubt any of these racist extremists believe anything Obama says is true.  They are part of the problem, not the solution.  This is not the time to declare &#39;war&#39; against Obama and Black Lives Matter as former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh tweeted in the aftermath.   Nor is it the time to claim the Obama&#39;s own words have led to blacks only interested in killing cops, as racist Iowa congressman and Number 1 Hispanic Hater Steve King proclaimed (which isn&#39;t even remotely true, some cops do act &#39;stupidly,&#39; they&#39;re human).  And last but not least, Sarah Palin, a clueless joke of a former Governor of Alaska who quit to become a famous media whore, her comments aren&#39;t even worth repeating.  After all, she&#39;s the type of person that would blame Obama for having a bad hair day.  Spewing more hate speech is not going to solve anything; it&#39;s only going to create more of the same type of behavior if not worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/DallasPoliceShooting?src=hash&quot;&gt;#DallasPoliceShooting&lt;/a&gt; has roots in first of anti-white/cop events illuminated by Obama...Officer Crowley. There were others.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Steve King (@SteveKingIA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SteveKingIA/status/751490647799005184&quot;&gt;July 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This is not the time to say hurtful things that target African-Americans.  Nor is this the time to do the same against Police Officers.  Most African-Americans and Police Officers are good people.  In fact, saying hurtful things only encourages others to commit violence out of revenge, hate and spite.  It&#39;s not their fault any of this happens.  The problem is bigger than that.  So while most of America holds on to each other and comforts themselves, we are left to hear the voices of the extremists, who often complain the most and speak the loudest.  Unfortunately, our society notices negativity more than positivity as it attracts more attention.  Turn on the five o&#39;clock news and dare to tell me that you will find anything positive on the news.  You might be lucky if you do, but most stories are the ones that resonate with viewers; the violence, the deaths, the rapes, the burglaries and the general hate we constantly hear about.  This is clear with those like Joe Walsh, who refuses to apologize for his opinions on Obama and the African American community, because to people like him, we can&#39;t blame the cops for anything, therefore, it&#39;s all the Blacks fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joe-walsh.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joe Walsh (the singer)&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;There&#39;s no reason to promote hate, so here&#39;s singer Joe Walsh instead.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So why does it seem that this is happening more commonly than it used to in the past?  There are a variety of factors, amongst them: easier access to news via social media, easier access to guns, especially with assault weapons no longer banned like they used to be, and more extremist behavior leading to a widespread feeling of anger.  This is abundantly clear with Donald Trump, whose words are frequently blasted over the web within seconds.  A man who hardly says anything positive, most people see the hate-filled spew coming out of his mouth, and it makes everyone angry and filled with hate.  His supporters are angry over minorities they believe are the problem with America.  His detractors are angry for targeting minorities and blaming them for everything.  This is not the voice of the American majority, yet this is all we hear about, leading people to have a narrow impression of America.  It&#39;s only the few hate-filled people with violent tendencies that end up causing physical and mental anguish, a task done easier with easy access with guns.  This is not what America is really like, we need to focus on the voices who want to heal, not the few who want to &#39;go to war.&#39;  &lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;America is better than this.  We&#39;re all upset by this, as we should be.  But the best solution to heal our wounds is to come together, not tear us apart.  Focus on the love and compassion, not the hate and anger.  I know that not all people are fueled by hate, and most aren&#39;t like this.  It&#39;s up to the passionate majority to dismiss the viewpoints of the racist minority by speaking up.  This is not the time to deny that anything&#39;s wrong, nor to stay silent.  That only allows the Donald Trump&#39;s and Joe Walsh&#39;s of the world to convince us that they&#39;re the truth.  They&#39;re not the voice of the America I love and cherish.  These voices must be minimized through rejection of their bigoted ways.  Only then can the healing process begin.  Enough is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Donald The Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In an election where Donald Trump has seemingly offended just about everyone that&#39;s not an old white Christian, it was only inevitable that Donald Trump would be accused of Anti-Semitism.  With all the Islamophobia Donald Trump keeps spreading, it&#39;s hard to forget that the Jews have historically been hated on by the majority of non-Jews.  Recently, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with money in the background and a Star of David symbol proclaiming  &#39;Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.&#39;  Trump took it down two hours later and replaced it with a circle replacing the Jewish Star.  Does this make Donald Trump Anti-Semitic or just plain stupid.  Here are my thoughts on Trump&#39;s history of Anti-Semitism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/frozen.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Frozen&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Offended yet?  You shouldn&#39;t be...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true that Donald Trump will say or do anything to get attention.  He&#39;d be the first in line to criticize Jews if he felt he would get a voting advantage from it, just like he does to the Hispanics, Muslims, Blacks, Asians, Millennials, Women, Liberals, Disabled, Presidents, Secretary of State&#39;s, Governors, Senators, Congressmen and Congresswomen, Supreme Court Justice&#39;s, Catholics, Poor, LGBTers, well, just about everyone that&#39;s not white or Christian.  In this respect, it&#39;s hard to say whether Donald Trump is a genuine bigot or an acting bigot.  Either way, he&#39;s a bigot.  But while all this goes on, Donald Trump has shown a softness for White Supremacists and Dictators across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has always jumped on actions and/or words committed by minorities, whether it&#39;s ISIS inspired terrorists like the scoundrel who committed the Orlando and San Bernardino acts, or any black or Hispanic male that shoots and kills someone.  But when it comes to White Supremacists, Donald Trump often agrees with their ideas and retweets them.  Just like he did with that stupid Anti-Semitic Hillary picture.  He&#39;s liked their messages before, he showed little anger when being endorsed by the infamous former Grand Wizard of the KKK, David Duke.  But when an undocumented immigrant in Oregon who was deported six times kills a few people, a story that hardly made national news, Donald Trump was screaming about it in anger.  This seemingly Aryan viewpoint of Donald Trump&#39;s makes him look Anti-Semitic, but is he really Anti-Semitic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump-star.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Star&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Offended now?  Now that&#39;s more offensive.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Trump didn&#39;t create that image; a White Supremacist did.  But that doesn&#39;t stop the picture from being Anti-Semitic.  The loser who made this drawing clearly plays on negative Jewish stereotypes of Jews having money and being corrupt with money.  While it&#39;s true that there are other hexagrams (a word Donald Trump is probably too stupid to know what one is) used by other religions; Christians, Hindus, even Muslims; most people would probably identify it as associated with Judaism.  Clearly, Donald Trump was too stupid to see that the image was Anti-Semitic when he posted it, but took it down after receiving criticism.  All in a day&#39;s work for someone who claims to be Pro-Israel yet can&#39;t recognize an image as being anti-Semitic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump and his idiot associates tried to claim the image was not Anti-Semitic, that the star in question was just an ordinary star or a Sheriff&#39;s star badge, but these dweebs fail to recognize that an ordinary star is most commonly associated with having five points, while a Sheriff&#39;s star can have anywhere from five to seven points.  Hardly universal for a Sheriff&#39;s star.  But what Donald Trump and his idiot associates are clueless to is that the star itself doesn&#39;t make it Anti-Semitic, it&#39;s the reinforcement of negative stereotypes associated with Jews and money.  He can&#39;t change the meaning of a drawing he didn&#39;t create.  As my Dad loves to say, &quot;consider the source.&quot;  Something Donald Trump never bothers to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;col-md-6&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Donald Trump would make an absolutely ridiculous claim of Anti-Semitism against Disney for featuring a regular hexagram on a children&#39;s book for a children&#39;s movie; Frozen, an animated film released in 2013 about a princess who goes on a journey of some sort.  Anyone who thinks that image is offensive is clearly senile and demented.  There are no hidden messages in this book.  It&#39;s just a book cover.  This is the definition of an ordinary star, one that mentions &quot;with 50 stickers.&quot;  There&#39;s nothing slanderous nor racist about stickers from a kid&#39;s book made by Disney.  Sorry Donald, that&#39;s not a Star of David.  There&#39;s nothing Jewish about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So is Donald Trump against my religion?  Probably not, but he&#39;s stupid and ignorant for not knowing something that&#39;s anti-Semitic.  He has a son-in-law who&#39;s Jewish, with Jewish grandchildren, so I seriously doubt Trump hates Jewish people.  But not condemning Anti-Semitism and blindly running a campaign for White Supremacists is a sure sign that Donald Trump doesn&#39;t love Jewish people either.  To this idiot, it&#39;s all about winning by any means necessary.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;tweet col-md-6&quot; style=&quot;padding: 30px;&quot;&gt;
	&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Where is the outrage for this Disney book? Is this the &amp;#39;Star of David&amp;#39; also? &lt;br /&gt;Dishonest media! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Frozen?src=hash&quot;&gt;#Frozen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4LJBpSm8xa&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/4LJBpSm8xa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Donald J.

        <title>Halfway through 2016 - My Year in Review</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We&#39;ve reached the end of June, which essentially means we&#39;re halfway through the year.  I&#39;ve had a successful year so far, and I&#39;m aiming to continue that with an even better second half of the year.  So here&#39;s to me, but also to those who have supported me along the way, because I wouldn&#39;t be the person I am without the loving support of my family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/adam-barley.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Adam&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I&#39;ve won this quarter (and half).  Thanks for the encouragement today, Barley the Hop.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My year started off pretty bad; I was really sick.  It started just before my Dad&#39;s birthday on December 30th, and I don&#39;t know what got me, but it left me feeling awful.  I developed Walking Pneumonia, which helped me realize that there are far worse things than an Ear Infection.  I ended up with one of them afterwards, and that was no fun either.  It was not a good time for me, but it could have been a lot worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite that, I had a lot to look for and a lot I knew I was rebound greatly.  The reason for that, I was aiming for a full time job at Seterus.  After submitting my application and going through the interview process, I finally got my first time job as a Correspondence Support Specialist.  All the hard work I put in finally paid off, as I officially became an IBMer.  My first official day as an IBMer was February 15th, and I haven&#39;t looked back since.  It&#39;s the beginning of the next stage of my master improvement plan I&#39;ve been working on for the past five years or so.  Still a few steps left in that game but it&#39;s a significant milestone for me.  In fact, it was June 29th of last year that I began my career at Seterus.  It wasn&#39;t what I was expecting, but as my Mom always says, &#39;things happen for a reason,&#39; and somehow, I ended up at the right place at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an official IBMer has its perks.  Asides from a better paycheck, better benefits and 401K, I also get lots of PTO.  That led to my biggest trip so far in the year, a drive to Walla Walla, Washington, where I visited the area and beyond, with the biggest prize at the end, the mesmerizing Palouse Falls.  Walla Walla was a nice charming little town with lots of shops, wineries and surrounding views of the mountains, but Palouse Falls, and the drive up to there was amazing in itself, with the funky Palouse hills that looked like another planet.  It was a fun trip overall, and made easier thanks to PTO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/IBM.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;IBM&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I&#39;m an IBMer!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another highlight has been my evolving programming skills, including this blog page.  I&#39;ve made projects out of Ruby on Rails and various JavaScript techniques, along with converting this blog page through Jekyll.  I&#39;m working on a project made from Ember.js, a lot of fun with that one.  Stay tuned.  I&#39;ve also found a niche with my writing.  I&#39;m able to express myself more freely and happily.  I particularly like the live blog posts I did for Kobe&#39;s last game and the NBA Draft.  Those to me are where I&#39;m at my best, since I&#39;m thinking on my toes to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the first half of the year contains my favorite day of the year, May 10, a.k.a. my birthday.  I took the day off from work, which I can now do without worrying about not getting paid, and like many of my birthdays, the weather was perfect!  I spent the day with my Mom in Hood River, my favorite hip town along the Columbia River Gorge.  For lunch, my Mom and I went to pFriem, a brewery along the riverfront.  The lunch was perfect, along with all the beers we tried.  I enjoyed the Belgian Strong Dark and Pêche.  My Mom really found her liking for Saisons, the Black Saison and Lemon Saison. Now my Mom talks about nothing but Saisons with beer.  I love it!  To me, that&#39;s the best part of it all.  After a nice trip to Hood River, taking pictures with my Olloclip I received for my birthday, and getting a pFriem t-shirt with the bear cheering Op Uw Gezondheid, we headed back home before having a nice dinner at Decarli with my sister and Dad.  I love my birthday, no matter how old I&#39;m getting, and as an added bonus, my co-workers decorated my desk and gave me a birthday card.  Yippee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hood-river.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hood River&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hood River is nice!  Being there on my birthday made it nicer!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first half of the year has also been good to my family.  My Mom had a successful event for Shir Tikvah called Shirlandia.  The people there just loved it!  She called it her best event ever.  I didn&#39;t go, but much praise to my Mom and the great work she does for Shir Tikvah.  Hearing all these people talk great about my Mom makes me a proud son.  My Dad has been hard at work too for Steam Engineering.  His hard work and dedication helped them get a big client, Harry&#39;s Fresh Foods.  I&#39;m glad for my Dad.  Now if they can only catch that a**hole Dave, my Dad will be really good.  And how can I forget about my wonderful sister Jenn, whose work as a stay-at-home coder for PBS West continues to impress her bosses wherever they are.  Jenn&#39;s come a long way from her unhappy days at her old job and continues to amaze me with her knowledge of medical terminology and radiology skills.  Having my family happy makes me even happier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve having a great year so far, despite the rocky start.  I feel good about myself and know that this is only the beginning for me.  I have plenty of stuff planned for the latter half of the year and I&#39;m feeling great!  I hope all of you reading this are great as well.  Life is good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Brexit 101</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I wasn&#39;t going to say anything about the global phenomenon known stupidly as &#39;Brexit,&#39; it doesn&#39;t really affect me personally since I don&#39;t live in the United Kingdom.  It&#39;s really an issue out of my league.  But after seeing the English soccer team lose an epic upset to Iceland in Euro 2016, I&#39;ve decided to say a few words based solely so I can use the following joke: England just brexited Euro 2016.  The timing couldn&#39;t be any better.  Here are my thoughts on Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/iceland.jpeg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Thanks Iceland and its game winning striker Kolbeinn Sigþórsson for a perfectly timed Brexit joke.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Thanks Iceland and its game winning striker Kolbeinn Sigþórsson for a perfectly timed Brexit joke.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A brief brundown on Brexit.  Britains braimed brat the Bruropean Brunion is brad.  48% broted to Remain and 52% broted to Leave.  Brow brome breople brave bregrets brecause the Leave brupporters brade their braims brased on Xenophobia and the Breconomy is brinking.  Brat&#39;s the brasics of Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Enough of the stupid portmanteaus.  I hate portmanteaus, but that&#39;s another blog post by itself.  The whole notion of Brexit is based on conservative based Immigrant fearmongering, blaming them for all our problems.  It&#39;s no different to what&#39;s going on here in the United States with Donald Trump&#39;s blatant Immigrant-bashing Xenophobia.  Heck, one of the driving forces behind Brexit, former London Mayor Boris Johnson, looks like a British knock-off of Donald Trump.  The similarities between the two are uncanny, minus the British appearance for Boris Johnson.  Maybe it&#39;s the look after all.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;If I lived in the United Kingdom, I would vote to remain in the European Union.  I believe in collaboration with the rest of Europe over North Korea-based isolation any day.  The people who believe the European Union was making them &#39;slaves&#39; somehow don&#39;t understand what freedom truly is.  It&#39;s not about fear of Immigrants.  Yet some people continue to scare people into believing the Immigrants and Poor are the root of all our world&#39;s problems.  These people claim they&#39;re somehow affected by Immigrants.  Most people probably don&#39;t interact with Immigrants on a daily basis nor understand that most of them are harmless.  It&#39;s no different to our attitude here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/boris-johnson.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&#39;s British brother from another mother, Boris Johnson&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Donald Trump&#39;s British brother from another mother, Boris Johnson&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Of course, it&#39;s no surprise our Idiot &#39;Republican&#39; Presidential Candidate Donald Trump supports this.  He claims &#39;The U.S. is next.&#39;  But we&#39;re not part of the European Union.  We&#39;re not enslaved by anything, especially immigrants.  But Donald Trump wants to scare people.  That&#39;s his only game.  Immigrants aren&#39;t the problem for us.  They&#39;re not the problem for the U.K. or anywhere else in the world.  It&#39;s people like Trump who are the problem, greedy power-seeking egomaniacs wanting to do as they please with no regard for anyone else.  That won&#39;t change in the U.K. whoever becomes the Prime Minister now that David Cameron resigned.  It will be someone else like Boris Johnson abusing the power at the expense of the common-man instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/trump-scotland.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Out in Scotland merely to promote his golf course, where the majority of Scotland voted to REMAIN in the European Union.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Out in Scotland merely to promote his golf course, where the majority of Scotland voted to REMAIN in the European Union.  Has Donald Trump ever gotten the memo?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;From what I understand, Brexit is a bad idea.  It reeks of fear-mongering with no solutions to actually help the United Kingdom.  It won&#39;t free them from anything.  It makes them look weaker and more isolated from the rest of Europe.  The European Union was enacted to prevent World War III or any other World War.  The United Kingdom has always been our strongest ally and it&#39;s a shame that people would buy into this hate filled garbage.  It&#39;s a preview of what life would be like with Dictator Donald Trump as Supreme Overlord of the United States of Donald Trump.  Thank god for the little guy, like Iceland, to show the English how it&#39;s done.  Poetic justice couldn&#39;t have written a better metaphor than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>NBA Draft - The Future is Now</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;4:32 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Tonight is the 2016 NBA Draft, where the young stars join their new teams.  For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like they did last year with D&#39;Angelo Russell.  While Russell wasn&#39;t an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype.  Who will the Lakers take with the number 2 picks.  All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be announced in 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/brandon-ingram.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Brandon Ingram.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Here&#39;s hoping Brandon Ingram is the next Lakers All-Star&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:37 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;The first pick is announced, and no surprise, it&#39;s Ben Simmons, the Australian sensation from LSU.  I would have loved for the Lakers to get this kid, has lots of potential, but no surprise he goes to Philadelphia.  Maturity issues aside, this kid has great skills.  With Philadelphia done with its rebuilding project, he can be the anchor for a franchise desperate for some wins.  They deserve some brotherly love, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:43 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;The Lakers have the second pick, and they take Brandon Ingram, with little surprise.  Ingram is a natural replacement to Kobe with his size and length, along with his shooting and perimeter skills.  Though I think Buddy Hield has potential to be a superstar and would have loved to see him taken by the Lakers, Ingram is the safer pick.  He&#39;s a little skinny, but so was Durant as a young&#39;un.  It&#39;s too early to give up on D&#39;Angelo Russell.  Hearing ESPN take about a fantasy trade of Russell for Okafor is quite ironic.  Most people thought they would take Okafor but took Russell instead.  Equally ironic that Philadelphia is trying to trade him now, and rumbles about Russell with both two having character issues.  Boston has the third pick, a huge steal from Brooklyn from the Pierce-Garnett trade.  They&#39;re trying to get a veteran for the pick.  Now the drama begins.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:51 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Danny Ainge is known for trades in the drafts, they have a bright future with Isaiah Thomas at the point guard, a great coach with Brad Stevens and plenty of cap room to make deals.  Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, someone else.  Yep, it&#39;s Jaylen Brown from California.  A surprise to some, but I think Brown has potential to be a star.  Boston doesn&#39;t need a point guard and big men are missing at the top of the draft list.  I suspect Boston will keep him.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:53 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Phoenix has the fourth pick, and it&#39;s unknown which direction they will go.  Eric Bledsoe is talented but injury-prone, while they traded the wrong point guard by sending Isaiah Thomas to acquire Brandon Knight.  Random Boston thought, Jaylen Brown was the captain of his chess team in middle school?!?  Wow!  But back to Phoenix, they have decent players but weren&#39;t healthy.  I think Buddy Hield would be great for Phoenix, but Phoenix needs size, so a bigger man might be on the horizon.  Marquese Chriss from Washington, Dragan Bender, the Croatian Man of Mystery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/dragan-bender.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Dragan Bender.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Bonus points for playing in Israel, Dragan Bender.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:58 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;And with the fourth pick, Phoenix selects...Dragan Bender, the Croatian Man of Mystery, who last played for Maccabi Tel Aviv, Israel&#39;s best team.  He&#39;s only 18, so he didn&#39;t play that much according to the ESPN announcers.  Bonus points for playing in Israel.  Will he be the next Kristaps Porzingis (the fourth pick last year) or the next Darko Milicic?  We&#39;ll have to wait and see.  Either way, Minnesota has the fifth pick, and they need a point guard with a shot.  Buddy Hield is realistic, but Providence point guard Kris Dunn is the highest rated point guard in the draft, with defensive capabilities, which is new coach Tom Thibodeau&#39;s calling card.  We&#39;ll find out after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:06 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Minnesota&#39;s pick is in, and they select...Kris Dunn, the guard from Providence.  Sorry John Calipari, but Kris Dunn is the perfect choice for Tom Thibodeau.  Whether he becomes a star, who knows, I don&#39;t know much about his game, but Minnesota has a bright future with Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns and Zach Lavine.  Now New Orleans has the sixth pick.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:09 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;New Orleans needs some guards to complement Anthony Davis.  A disappointing season last year, Davis clearly needs someone else who can perform consistently.  Aaron Gordon, Tyreke Evans and Jrue Holiday have been all inconsistent.  Oh, and Kris Dunn has some shiny shoes courtesy of JC Penneys.  Yippee.  But sad childhood story for Dunn, he deserves credit.  Hope he helps the Timberwolves out.  Back to New Orleans, they need Buddy.  And watching the NBA Reporter Alert on ESPN, it appears that&#39;s the direction they&#39;re going.  Official announcement waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:13 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;And they took Buddy Hield with the sixth pick.  Great pick for New Orleans, and a perfect fit for them.  I like this kid&#39;s shooting and spunk.  Steph Curry-like potential, clearly the player New Orleans needs to complement Anthony Davis.  And he&#39;s a Senior, so there&#39;s plenty of experience there.  They just compared him to Voshon Lenard, there&#39;s a name I haven&#39;t heard in years.  Gotta love the Bahamas spirit the Buddy Hield brings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/dunn-kris-gucci.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Kris Dunn&#39;s Shoes&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Look at Kris Dunn&#39;s shoes.  Wow!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:17 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Denver has the seventh pick, and they have no direction.  They don&#39;t have a star, a bunch of talented B star players like Kenneth Faried and Danilo Galinari.  They haven&#39;t had a star since they traded Carmelo Anthony (this pick was part of that trade).  The jury&#39;s still out on Emmanuel Mudiay, so Denver can go anywhere with this pick, but appear set on Kentucky&#39;s Jamal Murray (now John Calipari can stop lobbying this kid).  He almost went to Oregon, but ended up at Kentucky with Coach Cal.  Yet Oregon made it to the Elite Eight and was a #1 seed.  But anyways...&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:21 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Denver took Jamal Murray, the best rated player left in the draft.  Calipari believes he will lead all rookies in scoring.  We&#39;ll see, but I can&#39;t stand Calipari.  I&#39;ve mentioned him more times than any other coach in this blog.  For Denver, nice pick, but they need direction and a cornerstone.  His comparison, Michael Redd, another player who I haven&#39;t heard about in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:23 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Now we come to the most dysfunctional team in the NBA, the Sacramento Kings.  Anyone who thought George Karl would mesh with DeMarcus Cousins is clearly stupid, as their issues clouded everything with that franchise.  Cousins is the best pure center in the NBA, Sacramento made a mistake firing Michael Malone two years ago.  But David Joerger makes sense as a coach for Cousins.  Rajon Rondo looked decent as their point guard, and they still have Rudy Gay, though he&#39;s likely trade bait.  WIth a nice new simple logo, who should Sacramento take?&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:26 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Sacramento takes Marquese Chriss, the power forward from the Washington Fuskies.  He gets the stay in purple, but I don&#39;t know much about him or his game, since Washington is still lagging behind Oregon.  But they&#39;re trading this pick to the Phoenix Suns, who are getting Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender, according to ESPN&#39;s Andy Katz.  Phoenix has purple too.  First trade of the night!  According to the stats, Marquese Chriss got more fouls than anyone else in the history of the world it seems.  No one ever talks about foul stats.  No wonder I don&#39;t know about him.  I doubt he would&#39;ve done much for Sacramento, and I would be surprised if he becomes anything more than an average player.&lt;/p&gt;
	
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:31 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Toronto, fresh off their best season ever, has the ninth pick, courtesy of the New York Knicks via Denver.  If DeMar DeRozan doesn&#39;t bolt, their first priority, Toronto will still contend in the East.  They shockingly beat the Cavs two times in the Eastern Conference Finals.  They select Jakob Poeltl, the University of Utah Austrian sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:33 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Jakob Poeltl played well at Utah, but didn&#39;t do much against Oregon in the Pac-12 Conference Championship game.  He was the Pac-12 Player of the Year.  Toronto is a good place for him; they don&#39;t need immediate contributions from &#39;the best Austrian import since the Von Trapp family.&#39;  International player going to Toronto, perfect!  Now the tenth pick, Milwaukee.  Commercial!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:40 pm - &lt;/strong&gt;Milwaukee has the tenth pick, another disappointment this year, the Bucks need some shooters but the highest rated players are bigs, and they need rebounding as well.  Steph Curry made more three pointers in 2016 than the entire Milwaukee Bucks team in 2016.  Milwaukee can go anywhere, and they select...Thon Maker, the super mysterious Power Forward from Australia, whose age is in question.  Born in Sudan and escaped at the age of 6, moved to Australia for 8 years, moved to the United States at 14, then moved to Canada.  That&#39;s a mouthful.  A high risk-high reward type of player, with the mystery angle the biggest issue.  The buzz word the analysts said is &#39;unique.&#39;  He definitely appears unique from everything they&#39;ve said about him.  Similar to Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Greek Freak, Thon Maker is technically the only high school player in the draft, albeit a very odd way.  It&#39;s 5:44 pm and I&#39;m hungry for dinner, so now it&#39;s time for hot dogs.  I&#39;ll be back soon…&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;h3&gt;I&#39;m back!&lt;/h3&gt;
	
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:05 pm - &lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m back for a rundown of all the things I missed while I was making dinner, eating dinner, doing the dishes, and because it&#39;s trash night, took out the trash.  Here we go:  Orlando took Arvydas Sabonis&#39;s kid Domantas Sabonis with the 11th pick.  If only he was like his Dad in his prime.  Another reminder of what could have been for the Blazers with Arvydas Sabonis.  Even more shocking, Orlando traded him, Victor Oladipo and Ersan Ilyosava to Oklahoma City for Serge Ibaka!  The first major trade of the night.  I always felt OKC needed to trade Ibaka to become truly elite.  They fell just short against Golden State, and whether Kevin Durant comes back or not is the biggest mystery in the NBA period.  But Ibaka, though talented, was expendable for OKC.  He became a jump shooter when he would have been better as an interior player for OKC&#39;s sake.  They traded James Harden just to keep Ibaka...Chicago took Denzel Valentine with the 14th pick.  Nice tough kid from Michigan State who cost me street cred for losing to Middle Tennessee State in the NCAA tournament.  But Chicago is rebuilding, with Derrick Rose being traded to the Knicks...Atlanta took DeAndre Bembry from St. Joseph&#39;s with the 21st pick.  I liked his game when he played against Oregon in the NCAA Tournament, a street-smart player with the best afro since Josh Childress back in 2004 (who was also taken by the Atlanta Hawks).  A surprisingly high number of international players taken, including...Georgios Papagiannis (Greece), Juan Hernangomez (Spain), Guerschon Yabusele (France), Ante Zizic (Croatia), and just taken by Philadelphia with the 24th pick, Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot (France) - &lt;strong&gt;7:18 pm&lt;/strong&gt;  - I&#39;ve never heard of any of these players, I figured these are the types of players taken in the second round.  If one of those players pans out, I&#39;ll be the first to salute them, guarantee.  Oh, and Furkan Korkmaz (Turkey) with the 26th pick by wait for it...Philadelphia again!&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/img/deandre-bembry.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;DeAndre Bembry&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Look at DeAndre Bembry&#39;s Afro!&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:39 pm - &lt;/strong&gt; Three picks left in the first round, who wants to bet at least one of them will be an International player?  With the last three picks from Phoenix, San Antonio and Golden State, chances are high.  8 (true) International players already in the first round, tying an NBA record, with a chance to be broken.  The draft hosts are talking about college freshman being able to come back to school if they aren&#39;t taken in the first round.  Bad idea, then everyone would enter the NBA Draft, leaving their schools in the balance.  Players should own their decisions of leaving and staying in the draft.  Now we get a Raef LaFrentz reference for Phoenix&#39;s 28th pick, Skal Labissiere from Kentucky.  Ouch!  His family survived the Haiti earthquake, how sad.  And he&#39;s wearing a pink suit too.  Is pink the new black?  The last time the Spurs had a second-to-the-last first round pick, they took Tony Parker.  They always find steals, except Ian Mahmimi.  As for tonight, they selected Dejounte Murray, point guard for the Fuskies.  Seriously?  Oregon made it to the Elite Eight and it&#39;s Washington with two first round picks?  I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
			&lt;img src=&quot;/img/timothe-luwawu-cabarrot.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;h4&gt;Pink uniforms?!?  Only a Frenchman can pull it off.  Thanks Timothé Luwawu-Cabarrot!&lt;/h4&gt;
		&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:51 pm - &lt;/strong&gt; One more pick in the first round, one more chance for a foreign player to be selected to set the record.  And it&#39;s Golden State, who lost the same amount of games in the postseason as they did in the regular season, 9.  All the hard work in the regular season, one win away from winning the championship, and they lost three straight to Cleveland, without an answer to stop superhuman LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.  They threw their chance away like Steph Curry did his mouthguard after fouling out and getting ejected from Game 6 of the Finals.  They acted overconfident and played overconfident.  Cleveland deserved the title and outplayed them.  Brief note, Dejounte Murray&#39;s shoes looked like girls shoes, but it&#39;s to honor a cousin who died last summer.  I&#39;ll give credit for that.  But the final pick of the first round is in, and it&#39;s..................Damian Jones, a center from Vanderbilt.  So much for my International player.  Time for the second round.  And I&#39;m done for the night.  Will Oregon&#39;s Elgin Cook get selected?  Who will the Lakers take in the second round?  Those questions aren&#39;t blog worthy.  Good night!&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Editors Note: The University of Washington&#39;s nickname is purposely misspelled as Fuskies, that was by choice from the old days at Oregon when people would say &quot;Huck the Fuskies.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>The Big Short vs. Spotlight - Which Movie was better</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I was asked to compare two recent movies and Oscar nominated and winning movies from this years Academy Awards.  The challenger on the left is The Big Short, which won Best Adapted Screenplay.  The champion on the right is Spotlight, which won Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.  So which movie did I think was better?  Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/oscar.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;The Oscars&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Which movie should have won the Oscar?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Both movies are well done, featuring well known actors and are based on fairly recent events.  The Big Short, starring Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling, is based on the housing crisis that led to the recession, while Spotlight, starring Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams, is based on the Boston Globe’s Spotlight team uncovering the mass coverup of child sexual abuse by the numerous Catholic Priests in Boston (and all over the world).  Both have the realistic angle since the events actually happened (I’m not going to argue whether the facts are completely true, but that’s irrelevant at this point.  It’s not The Martian to say the least.  But their approach is quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;One thing I really liked about The Big Short was its light-hearted approach.  Though the drama was there, it showcased some lightly comedic efforts in presenting the film.  With this approach, director Adam McKay, more known for comedy films, is able to reach a different audience for those who strictly like dramas.  In addition, scenes from various celebrities explaining some of the concepts presented in the film, such as CDO’s (consolidated debt organizations) and synthetic CDO’s.  I didn’t particularly know the celebrities that well and some of them seem odd to explain them (i.e. Selena Gomez, who was like 15 when the actual events happened), but it helped the audience better understand what exactly was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Spotlight, on the other hand, takes a more traditional approach of raw emotional storytelling.  Clearly, their story didn’t require that much explanation, so instead, director Tom McCarthy was able to focus on the story and emotions of the characters in the film.  The amount of detail featured in the investigation deserves praise.  Spotlight takes a safer route with its presentation, while The Big Short took a slightly less serious approach.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/the-big-short.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;The Big Short&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;The Big Short&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The acting in The Big Short is well done, particularly Christian Bale’s role as Michael Burry, an eccentric hedge fund manager who looks like a slacker yet is able to determine the housing market is crumbling before anyone sees it.  Bale is well known for taking on a variety of roles and his extreme dedication to each role he takes, and his performance showcases this as he perfectly shows the slacker who’s quite intelligent yet dresses like a slob.  Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling also played their characters well, with Carell playing a hedge fund manager with distaste for the industry while Gosling plays a trader that’s cunning, smart and caring at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The acting in Spotlight is also superb, with Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams deserving the most praise.  Ruffalo plays reporter Michael Rezendes, whose dedication to finding the truth and emotional mission to help the victims makes him stand out, along with McAdams character, who provides a female touch.  The way the reporters handled talking to the victims was particularly touching.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The one thing that I didn’t care for about The Big Short was its transition from ‘Oh my god, we’re going to get rich off of this!’ to ‘Oh my god, the market has completely crashed, woe is me.’  It kind of seemed too abrupt to me after building the movie up as a ‘heist’ movie.  Overall, the scenes depicting the change were well done but it left me kind of depressed after the movie ended.  The two young characters looked like schmucks with their lack of appreciation for this, until Brad Pitt’s character criticizes them for it.  Done well, but it made some of the characters kind of unlikeable for being greedy.  Spotlight, on the other hand, featured moral characters that weren’t driven by greed, but by the truth.  Michael Keaton’s character, the editor of the Spotlight team, stands out for past digressions (which I won’t reveal for those not wanting spoilers).&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/spotlight.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Spotlight&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Spotlight&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;On the flipside, Spotlight’s plot didn’t particularly stand out.  I’ve seen other newspaper conspiracy type films with better and more interesting; Zodiac, the 2007 film about the Zodiac Killer had a far more interesting plot of the newspaper conspiracy trying to figure out who the Zodiac Killer was.  That to me was a far better and more fascinating film than the uncovering of the Catholic church protecting its pedophile priests.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Despite neither movie being perfect and having its flaws, I found The Big Short to be more interesting and better of the two films.  Working in the mortgage servicing industry, I learned a thing or two about mortgage loans and the housing market in general.  It was a more original approach to give it the light-hearted touch rather than Spotlight, the more conventional film.  Spotlight is still better than the previous Best Picture, Birdman, a movie I found to be odd, but not as good as some of the past Best Picture winners; Slumdog Millionaire (2008), No Country for Old Men (2007), The Departed (2006) and Million Dollar Baby (2004) are four films from this millennium that won Best Picture that I loved.  Great emotional acting is always great to have, but at the end of the day, I’m driven by plot and originality more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Three Little Words</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I woke up Sunday morning, as I usually do, looking at my iPhone to check the news.  Like millions of others who woke up today, I was disgusted and saddened to hear that 49 people had been killed in a terrorist attack at an Orlando gay nightclub, Pulse.  Like most, I despise terrorism and hate whenever it occurs.  But stopping terrorism here in the United States and the world requires our nation and our allies to come together.  But instead, we have our Republican congressmen and wannabe congressmen furthering dividing us and claiming defeating Terrorism is as easy as saying three little words...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/orlando.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Stand strong with Orlando.&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Stand strong with Orlando.  That&#39;s what love is all about.  Not words.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Stopping terrorism cannot be defined simply by the words you use to describe it.  So when Donald Trump and his idiot Republican friends suggest that President Obama and Hillary Clinton need to use three little words in order to stop it, it is both ridiculous and counterproductive to believe that the United States and our world powers are going to win the war on terror simply by uttering the phrase &quot;Radical Islamic Terrorist.&quot;  No time in the history of the world has anything been changed simply by uttering a phrase.  It involves actions and cooperation, not divide, to defeat evil.  Obama is aware of this, and doesn&#39;t need to say it just to defeat them&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Terrorism is terrorism, attacks designed to scare and hurt many and all who love.  There are all type of terrorism, and Obama correctly identified the attacks as terror and hate, but the Republicans think that doesn&#39;t do anything.  They claim Obama is soft and doesn&#39;t have a clue about what&#39;s going on, as if the only way to stop these attacks is to utter the phrase &quot;Radical Islamic Terrorist.&quot;  There is no need to use this phrase, and in reality, causes more harm than good, as anti-Islam Republican&#39;s have long been part of the problem, not the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda claim to be driven by Islam, but all they really want is power.  They merely use the teachings of Islam and pervert them to justify their actions, even though they&#39;re not driven by religion, but rather power.  So to suggest that these terrorist groups are Radical Muslims is in insult to those who preach Islam.  As Muhammad Ali, who recently passed away stated, &quot;True Muslims know the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion.&quot;  So using these three little words defeats the whole purpose of stopping terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda; rather it legitimizes their beliefs that the West is at war with Islam as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;True Muslims know the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion.&lt;footer&gt;Muhammad Ali&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;After the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush proclaimed that &quot;we are not at war with Islam,&quot; and this is the way it should be.  But Republicans today, too eager to blame the Muslims for everything and full of hate, are the ones clearly at war with Islam, willing to use them as a scapegoat.  That&#39;s why they insist that we utter three little words to describe them, as if that alone will make a difference in our fight.  It&#39;s no surprise that their words are being used by Terrorists to convince them to join their groups.  To a society that&#39;s more Islamophobic by the day with those who preach Islam being targeted for their religion and being mocked as &#39;terrorists,&#39; the Republicans are making things worse by uttering those three little words and targeting Muslims as a whole, implying a religious war that doesn&#39;t exist.  The effect they have on their constituents is clear in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;We will never win the war on terror here while Republicans keep dividing us and encouraging hatred against Muslims, or groups that are mistaken for Muslims based on their appearance, i.e. Sikhs, Buddhists.  For every major attack committed by someone who claims support or has actual ties to terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda, there are hundreds of people here hurling insults at Muslims, attacking them for their appearance and looking at them with disgust.  As Republican&#39;s are largely interested in political power themselves by attracting the white population that hates minorities, Muslims included, it can be said that they are happy with their war on Islam.  That&#39;s why it&#39;s important for them to use three little words.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/orlando2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Orlando&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Obama criticized Trump for those three little words.  Didn&#39;t stop Terrorism when Obama uttered them.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Terrorism is something we all must stop, and childish name calling is not going to be the difference between winning and losing that battle.  It&#39;s never accomplished anything more than encourage those to continue their fight.  We win our fights with action and collaboration, not through petty words and mudslinging.  So while the Republicans live in a fantasy world where words wins battle, anyone with an actual brain knows how our greatest battles have been actually won.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;When it&#39;s all said and done, leadership, more than anything, is what holds us together and defeats evil.  Instead, we have Republican&#39;s playing the blame game, refusing to accept anything Obama even says as true and criticizing him every chance they have, even over the littlest things.  This lack of leadership and obstructionism is sickening and demeaning to those who have died.  They feign their condolences but clearly are more interested in attacking Obama for his choice of words.  This is not how we get things done.  We accomplish things through actions, not words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Rape - A Nasty Side Effect of Society&#39;s Mistreatment of Women</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Much buzz on the news is about a rapist name Brock Turner, a former Stanford swimmer who raped an unconscious woman and received just six months in prison for it, despite being convicted of three felony sexual assault charges.  Though the defendant claims he understands what he did was wrong, he has managed to show how little responsibility he has actually taken for his crimes, feeling like he is the victim just as much as the woman he raped. Cases like this show just how little regard some men have for women in general and how that, more than anything, leads to rape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/stanford.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Stanford&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;It can happen anywhere, Stanford University is no exception.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Blame it on the Alcohol. Many young college kids love to drink alcohol, even when they&#39;re not supposed to.  There&#39;s nothing anyone can do to stop that.  But drunken frat parties and binge drinking don&#39;t always led to rape.  Nor does it give anyone a reason to act like it&#39;s the woman&#39;s fault for getting raped because she was drunk and made bad decisions.  No one ever shames the man when he gets drunk and makes bad decisions.  Brock Turner had no problem blaming his actions on the alcohol, as if once you&#39;re drunk, you&#39;re incapable of making a decision.  That is not the truth.  You own your decisions whether you&#39;re drunk or not.  And Brock Turner chose to rape a woman while she was unconscious.  He chose to flee when two men stopped him from his attack.  These are actions of someone who chose to make a horrible decision, not someone who is incapable of making a decision. It&#39;s not the alcohol&#39;s fault.  Surely, there&#39;s something else that contributes to rape by a drunk man.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Blame it on the Culture.  Young college kids are learning to be adults for the first time in their lives.  They often act irresponsibly with frats, sororities and anything that involves partying in general.  But people have a choice to do those things.  I never did in college, and many other people often say no.  Brock Turner felt he had to go after women no matter the cost.  He claims peer pressure made him do it.  But is it worth the so-called peer pressure when you know what you&#39;re doing is wrong.  It&#39;s not culture that leads to rape.  It&#39;s those who make the decision to rape that leads to rape.  After all, party culture does not equal rape culture.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Blame it on the Victim.  Of course, if a woman is flirting and sending you signs that she wants you, you have to say yes no matter what happens.  Brock Turner claims she started it, that she wanted to have sex with him, that is was all consensual.  Problem was, the woman was unconscious.  Nowhere in Brock Turner&#39;s version of events did it mention that the woman was unconscious.  Sure, if a woman suggests sex at that time, you can have sex at the time.  But try asking her if she&#39;s unconscious.  If the answer is not yes, it&#39;s not consensual, end of story.  If a woman says no, it&#39;s not consensual, end of story.  If a woman says nothing, it&#39;s not consensual, end of story.  It&#39;s not the victim that leads to rape. It&#39;s the perpetrator alone who makes that decision.  Otherwise, it&#39;s consensual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hero.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hero&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;This is what a real man looks like, one of the two who stopped a rape in progress.  Showing the rapist&#39;s picture is a waste of time.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So where does the blame lie?  Misogynistic attitudes towards women is the primary cause.  Men who see women as objects, as if it&#39;s a game to win their heart, without any emotional feelings for their emotions or well being.  These are the types of attitudes that rapists have.  Men like Brock Turner, whom prosecutors argued in court made numerous attempts inappropriately seeking out women, touching them in the wrong places, being way too persistent.  If anyone felt for a woman&#39;s feelings and needs, they would be respectful and leave them alone if said woman was not interested.  Real men treat women with respect, care about their feelings, and wouldn&#39;t have sex with a woman without her consent.  But for men with misogynistic attitudes and masculine superiority, it often becomes all about power and domination over the &#39;lesser&#39; sex, as if it&#39;s all about them.   For many, rape is an aggressive culmination of this type of behavior, and until society figures out how to reverse this type of behavior, it&#39;s never going to stop.  That&#39;s why when these type of people get drunk, their attitude towards women is fully realized, as their inhibition telling them what they&#39;re doing is illegal and wrong goes out the window.  It&#39;s not the alcohol, it&#39;s their attitude unleashed.  Brock Turner didn&#39;t have the slightest bit of respect for that woman, and still doesn&#39;t.  Blaming everyone and everything else but himself doesn&#39;t fix anything.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s wrong for men to believe that women are at fault, or that their feelings don&#39;t matter.  For some, like Brock Turner&#39;s Dad, it&#39;s his son who has to live with all the suffering and embarrassment, not thinking for one second about the victim, or that the fact that his son committed a felony crime by raping an unconscious woman.  What might seem to be &#39;20 minutes&#39; is never forgotten by the victim; they have to live with that forever.  But with people like Dan Turner, a slap on the wrist is all that rapists need because it&#39;s &#39;just one mistake&#39;.  If only the victim got a slap on the wrist.  But she didn&#39;t.  She was raped.  Maybe if he thought about her feelings, he might&#39;ve second guessed the things he said.  Because it&#39;s not &#39;just one mistake,&#39; it&#39;s a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The legal system is supposed to help the victims.  But sometimes, they turn a blind eye, often times blaming the victim, or assuming felony rape is not worthy of such a long sentence because the perpetrator is supposed to be an outstanding citizen (when he&#39;s clearly not for raping a woman).  The Judge who sentenced Brock Turner to 6 months in prison spent his time talking about not wanting to ruin his life.  It&#39;s not about his life.  It&#39;s not about his future.  It&#39;s about justice for the woman.  The Judge deserves to be fired for his lenient sentence.  It&#39;s as if a felony didn&#39;t happen.  Aren&#39;t felonies supposed to land you at least one year in prison?  Again, had the judge listened to what the woman went through, he would&#39;ve seen things differently, rather than believing the perpetrator was the actual victim.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The sad truth is that our society bashes women to some level; whether it&#39;s a Presidential candidate calling women fat pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals, bimbos and bleeding out of &#39;you know where,&#39; a judge who ignores a woman&#39;s plea for justice, focusing on protecting the rapist himself, or those who call women sluts every time they have too much to drink and have sex but don&#39;t make such remarks about men.  This problem is much bigger than Brock Turner.  It happens everywhere, college universities, businesses, you name it.  Women need to be heard, to speak up and fight back.  This brave woman let the world know how she felt, and her words are nothing short of powerful and honest.  Having just read what she had to write, all I can say is thank you for standing up and speaking out.  We need more people as brave as her, as heroic as the two men who stopped the rape, and less people like the rapist who pretends to care but blames everyone but himself.  It&#39;s time we stop focusing on the bad people and focus on the good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Muhammad Ali, the Greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; On Friday night, late in the evening, I found out that Muhammad Ali, the legendary boxer, had passed away at the age of 74.  Though I&#39;m not a boxing fan and I don&#39;t know any boxing fans, there was always one boxer that everyone knew about, Mr. Muhammad Ali.  Though some would argue that Mike Tyson is equally famous, he was known for the wrong reasons.  But Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest, as he frequently claimed, but he was the most important athlete of the 20th Century in any sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ali.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Muhammad Ali&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only seventeen years prior in 1947 that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in the biggest sport at the time, baseball, becoming an American hero at a time when blacks were still segregated in some parts of the country.  Back then, African-Americans were just starting to participate in professional sports with the white majority.  The Civil Rights act didn&#39;t pass until 1965, so at a time when the African American community needed a powerful voice, in entered Muhammad Ali, who first became popular in 1964 after an upset of Heavyweight Champion of the time, Sonny Liston.  But unlike the African American athletes of the past, Muhammad Ali, then known by his birth name Cassius Clay, was not afraid of anyone.  He said what he felt, and was confident in what he said, the type of swagger that was missing from the African American community in sports at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the former Cassius Clay changed his name to Muhammad Ali and converted to Islam shortly after beating Sonny Liston, he did not care what others thought of him, he did what he felt was right for him, and wasn&#39;t afraid to let people know.  He stood up for those afraid to speak out their minds and did so with such an incredible sense of confidence and proudness.  For many, Muhammad Ali was the voice of a community just starting to gain basic rights they previously didn&#39;t have, as the Civil Rights act passed the following year.  Obviously, there were men like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, but Ali, being a sports figure, didn&#39;t have to do the things he did, which made his voice different from those whose main objective in life was to fight for African American rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ali3.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Muhammad Ali&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Muhammad Ali: The Champ&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Ali was the greatest boxer at the time, and still is seen today as the greatest by many; the skill set he displayed pushed him to the top.  But his fearlessness outside the boxing ring made him the legendary figure he is known for today.  With the Vietnam War brewing, Ali was drafted to fight in the war.  But Ali stood his ground, proclaiming he objected to serving, citing his religious beliefs.  He stood up for what he truly believed in, sacrificing everything while fighting charges for draft evasion.  There were plenty of people who despised him for not answering the draft call, claiming him &#39;un-American&#39; for not serving his country when they needed him, but Ali, in his own words, &#39;had no reason to fight the Viet-cong.&#39;  While many athletes, even those today are too afraid to suffer the consequences for standing up to causes, Ali did not flinch, and though he wasn&#39;t able to fight from 1968-1971 as he fought the charges, he did so believing in what he believed in, while losing his championship titles in the process.  Most athletes wouldn&#39;t sacrifice the money lost and reputation suffered for taking a stand but Ali wasn&#39;t afraid of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali returned to the ring in 1971, and although he wasn&#39;t as youthful as before, he still had the skill to be the champ, despite the younger blood out to get him.  Though he lost a big fight to Joe Frazier, a boxer whom would become Ali&#39;s biggest rival, people still loved Ali&#39;s attitude and skill, rooting for him to be the champ once again.  He became worldwide known in the process, with two of his biggest fights in his career happening overseas.  First was the &#39;Rumble in the Jungle&#39; against George Foreman in 1975 in what was known as Kinshasa, Zaire.  While there, he embraced the culture of those in the former Zaire, becoming a hero in the process.  He defeated then champion George Foreman in what was considered the biggest fight at the time, as many considered George Foreman the hardest hitting boxer around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ali4.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Muhammad Ali&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Ali, Bomaye!  Ali, Bomaye!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The other big fight took place the following year in his third and final fight against Joe Frazier, arguably his biggest rival.  Smokin&#39; Joe Frazier beat him the first match, but Ali beat him the second match.  As such, they agreed to fight on more time, in Manila, Philippines, in a fight known as &#39;The Thrilla in Manila.&#39;  Ali, the master trash talker, got into Frazier&#39;s head with his jaunts, and Ali won the match.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ali was not the same fighter after that, as his age started to show and in part to all the hits he took, began showing signs of Parkinson&#39;s disease, which he was officially diagnosed with in 1984, after his retirement in 1981.  But despite all of this, Ali was still beloved by many and an inspiration to those not willing to speak up.  He fought for his beliefs, had a strong sense of religion without judging others for theirs, and knew exactly how to entertain people.  Many of those who needed a voice got an empowering voice from Ali.  It&#39;s no wonder that he carried the torch for us in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta; no one else deserved such a higher honor in our Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ali2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Muhammad Ali&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;killa and a thrilla and a chilla, when I get that gorilla in Manila.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;In a time where Muslims are often chastised for those who commit acts of terrorism, Muhammad Ali stood up for real Islam, proclaiming the radical terrorists as inauthentic and not true believers of Islam.  Perhaps the most famous Muslim living, Muhammad Ali continued to profess his beliefs in Islam, even as some people attacked Islam and associating Islam with terrorism.  Ali knew better and spoke the truth, unapologetic and unafraid to do so.  So while some people may treat good Muslims bad, there was Ali standing up for the millions of Muslims who needed a strong voice.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;So when I heard Muhammad Ali has passed away, I was sad like many.  He was the greatest boxer, but even more important, the greatest sports humanitarian of his time.  As I&#39;ve seen many times, from 9/11 to the Boston Marathon Bombing, sports, more than anything, can bond people together like nothing else, heal people in a time of need and make people proud of their country.  Muhammad Ali, more than any athlete, embodied that notion, never wavering on his beliefs, speaking up for those who didn&#39;t have a voice while achieving greatness within his sport.  So while other famous athletes like Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods wouldn&#39;t speak up on social issues to preserve their financial and personal reputation, Ali was more than eager to speak his mind when he felt was right.  That, more than anything, made Ali the Greatest.  R.I.P. to a real legend in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, my sister Jenn complained to me that her laptop with Windows 7 automatically updated to Windows 10, without giving her a choice.  It made her angry, she refused to set it up for hours, and after a day of using it, Jenn lost internet access completely.  Not surprisingly, Jenn was pissed by the whole endeavor, in an extremely grumpy mood that not even myself could snap her out of.  Thankfully, Jenn found a way to revert her laptop to Windows 7 thanks to the wonders of instant data via the internet, and getting her Windows 7 back, Jenn was happy again as she should be.  But it&#39;s the principle that matters: Tech companies shouldn&#39;t be allowed to force programs onto your computers.  It goes against the very fiber of the American consumer industry, like a virus out to harm your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;I call Screen of Death on Microsoft&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;I recently bought a new laptop a few weeks ago running Windows 10, and I enjoy it.  A better OS than Windows 8, which was despised by most people, trying too hard to move to the tablet based technology without weaning people off of the classic laptop/desktop setting of Windows 7.  Windows 10 is a good mix of this.  But despite Microsoft&#39;s intent, they can&#39;t force programs onto a user&#39;s computer.  Some people enjoy Windows 7 and aren&#39;t ready to move on to Windows 10.  People should be able to upgrade as they see fit.  For me, I still use Microsoft Office 97, even though I know Microsoft Office 2010 is better, I just don&#39;t want to pay for it.  And I still use my copy of Adobe Photoshop 7.0 that I received from someone whom I consider to be the worst human being I&#39;ve ever met, but I&#39;m capable of making my own choices.  They still work for me, so why should I fork out money for something new.  Microsoft and Adobe shouldn&#39;t force me without choice to install a program without my input, especially when money is involved.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people make programs that have adverse affects on their computers, they call them viruses.  There&#39;s little difference between forcing someone to update to Windows 10 when they&#39;re in the middle of a big project and a virus that steals your information.  No matter who created the software, unwanted software is a virus.  It can have unintended consequences no matter the source of said virus and regardless of the intent.  Yet the tech giants insist that they have the ability to trick people into downloading their unwanted programs, sometimes without the option of saying no.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/apple-music.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Apple Music&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;I&#39;m not going to take a Chance on Apple Music (no pun intended)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Back in 2014, myself and millions upon millions of iTunes users found themselves with songs from a new U2 album, Songs of Innocence, that I neither asked for or knew existed.  Like many of those users, I don&#39;t like U2, never wanted nor never asked for a crappy U2 album.  You wouldn&#39;t want anyone to give you a program you don&#39;t want, why would you want Apple to download an album onto your iTunes without your permission.  Some less tech-savvy people may not be aware of how to remove said programs (or songs) and it&#39;s unfair to the consumer who doesn&#39;t want your crappy program without the option of saying ‘No&#39;.  If I want to buy the crappy U2 album, it&#39;s my choice, not Apple&#39;s.  Just like it&#39;s not my choice, nor anyone&#39;s to have a Trojan horse installed onto my computer.&lt;p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;So please Microsoft, while we are aware you want everyone to use Windows 10, it&#39;s not realistic that everyone will want it.  People like Windows 7 and their desktops/laptops may be better suitable with it than Windows 10.  This is especially true when in the middle of a big problem.  And to Apple, I wouldn&#39;t listen to U2&#39;s Songs of Innocence album even if Apple put a gun to my head forcing me to listen to it.  I have a right to choose. And while we&#39;re talking about Apple, stop trying to trick people into your Apple Music streaming service.  Streaming music for a fee each month is a stupid idea.  It works with movie streaming like Netflix since movies require a screen to watch, but music can be enjoyed everywhere and people have the right to listen to their music without a valid internet connection.  It&#39;s especially stupid when rappers like Chance the Rapper claim his new mixtape Coloring Book is free but require you to pay a subscription fee each month to listen to it without any other options to listen to it.  #LAME!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
