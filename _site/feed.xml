        <title>So He Finally Used the A-Word</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It took sixteen months, but the Idiot finally used the A-word he never likes to use: &lt;strong&gt;APOLOGIZE&lt;/strong&gt;.  What did it take for him to apologize?  A video mic drop recording of him saying some incredibly vulgar things about women, essentially bragging about hitting on a married woman and getting away with groping women because he’s a star.  He called it 'locker room banter,' I call it 'words a sexual predator would say.'  Now that he's used the A-word, he can now apologize to everyone he’s offended in his life.  Here's an partial list of everyone owed an apology.  He's offended so many people it's hard to keep track.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Six Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week Six for me is Rivalry Week Part 1.  Minnesota hosted Iowa for the Floyd of Rosedale and Oregon hosted Washington, winning twelve in a row against them but looking far worse now than they have at ay time in those twelve years.  As for the the rest of the games, another entertaining variety of match-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/floyd-of-rosedale.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Floyd of Rosedale&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;My proudest moment watching the Gophers at the Metrodome, carrying off Floyd of Rosedale&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I went to four games while I was at the University of Minnesota, and the last game against Iowa was the best game of the bunch.  They beat a rival and won a trophy.  So it went without saying that Minnesota really needed a win against Iowa, to prove their legitimacy as possible Big Ten contenders.  Unfortunately, while their defense looked strong, their offense sputtered and could only muster up 7 points, losing to Iowa 14-7 after an Iowa touchdown late in the fourth quarter put them up ahead for good.  While Minnesota has the running backs, they still lack consistency in the passing game.  A tough loss to swallow, but Iowa's defense is just as good, a good old classic Big Ten Slugfest.  Next week for Minnesota: a road trip to Maryland, Minnesota's first game against Maryland since they joined the Big Ten.  The last (and only) time they've met was in 1977.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/img/justin-herbert.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Justin Herbert&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Webfoots, Ducks, whatever you want to call them, they can't defend.&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The last time Oregon lost to Washington, I was a freshman at the U of O.  I remember watching the game on TV.  Hard to believe Oregon would end up winning the next twelve games.  But this year, Washington enters the game ranked #5 and statistically with the best defense in the country.  Oregon, on the other hand, couldn't stop a chair from scoring.  Wearing their Webfoots jerseys to honor the ancient days, Oregon made a surprising change at Quarterback starting true freshman Justin Herbert.  For the first time in a long time, Oregon looked completely overmatched and likely to get blown out.  And they were blown out, just as everyone figured, final score 70-21.  And just like that, the streak is over.  Oregon gets a much needed week off, but it doesn't look any easier as they face Davis Webb and the high-flying Cal offense.  It's not going to get any easier for the Ducks and with their defense as horrific as it's looked, this will not turn out well.  This may be the beginning of the end for Mark Helfrich.  I questioned how effective he'd be without Marcus Mariota leading the way and it hasn't been particularly pretty at times.  Oregon fans will be pissed, and should be.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
    		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/notre-dame-nc-state.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Notre Dame vs NC State&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
    		&lt;h4&gt;Thoughts to those affected by Hurricane Matthew, even in Raleigh the rain looks horrific.&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's tough to finish a season undefeated, no matter what conference you play in.  Houston, having beaten (a now overrated) Oklahoma at home, lost to high-scoring Navy 46-40.  Their slim chance to make the Playoffs unfortunately is over.  But they can still make a Big Five bowl game. --- Tennessee might be the most entertaining team in the country.  Every game they've played in this season has seen them make a big comeback, and against Texas A&amp;amp;M they came back from a 28-7 deficit.  Volunteers never say die.  But desite the comeback and leading the game into OT, Texas A&amp;amp;M won 45-38.  Gotta give the Vols credit for fighting back.  --- Who would've thought that when Colorado played USC, that the one ranked team would actually be Colorado.  But USC ended up winning 21-17.  What a shame.  --- Hurricane Matthew had a big impact on some of the games in that area.  It postponed LSU-Florida (which neither team has a shared open game to reschedule it, stay turned), and drenched games in the Carolinas.  I saw the rain on a clip of the Notre Dame-NC State game, it looked nasty.  --- Another nasty hit on Penn State kicker Joey Julius.  I didn't realize he had an eating problem.  For that, I apologize for my previous caption on him.  --- Michigan beat Rutgers 78-0.  Rutgers lost to Ohio State 58-0 last week.  Why are they in the Big Ten again? --- Miami fans started throwing litter all over the field after a penalty call went against them.  Only Miami, right?  ---  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson(+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nebraska (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baylor (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Sorry Norf Norf Lady</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Recently, I read about a viral video of a Christian woman, a mother of four, who blogged her video reaction upon listening to a rap song she heard on the radio, rapping the song line by line and getting upset over the lyrics.  The song in question, Norf Norf, by Vince Staples, is a typical example of a gangsta rap song.  Not surprisingly, the woman was quite offended that this song would appear on the radio, proclaiming the songs of the old days are better for kids.  Not surprisingly, that is simply not true, and there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/vince-staples.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Vince Staples&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Vince Staples, as featured on his new EP, Prima Donna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of songs on the radio that have inappropriate lyrics.  Some people may be surprised that plenty songs from way back then are about either slightly to very inappropriate things.  Every Breath you Take, by The Police?  A song about a guy stalking a woman who leaves him breathless.  Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix?  Like plenty of rock songs from that time, about drugs.  And who could forget all the pop songs from the old days singing about sex (Britney Spears, Christian Aguilera, anybody)?  But of course, it's only a problem for some when a rapper makes music about life in the streets.  There have been plenty of gangsta raps songs on the radio since the days of N.W.A. proclaiming &quot;Fuck Tha Police.&quot;  Vince Staples is certainly no different than any gangsta rapper from Long Beach or anywhere in the world.  To assume that music was more clean back in the days is wrong.  Nothing has really changed for rappers in the ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It's hard for many to understand living the street life because they don't live it.  It is disturbing for those who see it from the outside, myself included.  But what people don't ever think about is that most people who live in the streets don't actually want that life.  No one ever stops to think about the people of the ghetto themselves, rather they see them merely as a stereotype.  For people like Vince Staples, and countless of other people growing up in the ghetto, this is the only life they know, their normal.  They don't know anything else.  So when Vince Staples raps about 'running from the police,' that's because it's what he's used to.  It's not glamorizing like people assume, but their reality.  In fact, for some with skills like Vince Staples, it's a way out of that life.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While it's true that children shouldn't listen to inappropriate lyrics, it's also true that plenty of people don't pay attention to the lyrics of the songs.  Often times, rappers rap so fast that people don't bother to listen or understand the lyrics.  For those, it's all about the beat.  So for those who do listen to the lyrics, they shouldn't be that surprised.  Try listening to rappers like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Twista and tell me you can recite their lyrics off the dome.  And with songs like Panda by Desiigner on the radio constantly, who cares about the lyrics?  Does anyone know what the heck he's talking about?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
    		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/norf-norf-lady.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Norf Norf lady&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
    		&lt;h4&gt;If you don't like the music, don't listen to it.&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When it's all said and done, this woman shouldn't let her children listen to songs like this, but while she's entitled to her own opinion, she shouldn't slander rappers like Vince Staples over the content of their songs.  Their music isn't meant for kids, anyway, so like life in general, it's up to the parents to do their best to keep their kids from listening to this music, not complain about the rappers themselves or demanding such music not be played on the radio.  In this day and age, anyone can pull up Norf Norf or any other rap song on iTunes, youTube or any other website that features music.  It's up to the parents to set the good example.  There are plenty of people whose demographic is more suitable for songs like Norf Norf that enjoy the music, like myself.  But if I don't like a song or get offended by it (which isn't likely), I simply choose to ignore it because I can't decide for someone else whether they should listen to songs or not.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;When asked about it, Vince Staples defended the woman's right to have an opinion, stating that she can make up her own mind, but at the same time, pointing out that she doesn't understand what the song is all about, leading her to be frightened.  And that, in its essence, is what leads so many people to 'freak out.'  They have no idea what it's like to live in the ghetto.  Just as someone in the ghetto has no idea what it's like to be a devout Christian obsessed with all things Jesus.  There's no point for this woman nor anyone else outside to try to comprehend that life, but to me, understanding the struggle itself is what's most important when listening to music in general.  I'll never understand life in the ghetto, but I can certainly listen to a dope rapper and feel his/her struggle and emotion.  That's what makes rappers like Kendrick Lamar so great.  In the meantime, I'll play Norf Norf and try to figure out what the title Norf Norf means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Five Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week Five has plenty of great matchups, with three top ten conference battles for the first time: Stanford at Washington on Friday, Wisconsin at Michigan and Louisville at Clemson.  Meanwhile, it's the battle for the Governor's Victory Bell for Minnesota as they went to Penn State, while Oregon, after a demoralizing loss last week, head to Washington State, where they hope to avoid last years dysentery affected loss to Washington State&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joey-julius.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joey Julius&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;What in the heck did they feed Joey Julius?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The first game I went to at the University of Minnesota was a matchup against Penn State at the old Metrodome.  A good game aside, though Penn State won 28-27 thanks to a missed PAT from the Gophers.  Ten years later, the two programs have changed dramatically.  Minnesota was mired in bored mediocrity under Glen Mason, while Penn State had legendary coach Joe Paterno on the sideline.  Their program obviously crashed over the Jerry Sandusky scandal, while Minnesota got a burst of energy from Jerry Kill, who laid the foundation for Tracy Claeys.  This game had the signs of a close matchup, and it did not disappoint.  One thing that stands out for Penn State is their ridiculously large placekicker Joey Julius, who looks and tackles like a nose tackle but with kicking ability.  He laid some monster hits in previous games.  But Gopher LB Jaylen Waters delivered a cheap shot on him, getting ejected.  Pretty stupid.  On the flip side, the Gophers have the tallest  player in college football, 6-10 Tight End Nate Wozniak.  Also, I didn't realize Antoine Winfield Jr. was a cornerback, his dad was a great NFL cornerback.  But for the Gophers, their rushing game was a good as advertised, with Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks as a great 1-2 punch.  But Penn State, with homecourt advantage, squeaked out an overtime victory 29-26.  The Gophers had their chances, but Penn State made some big plays in the second half to end up with the victory.  Chances are, the Gophers would've won that game at home, but they'll need to improve next week as they host the suddenly struggling Iowa Hawkeyes next week at home for the battle of the Floyd of Rosedale.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;/img/dysentery.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Dysentery&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;The Cougs are right, Oregon has died of Dysentery&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As for the Oregon Ducks, it's clear that their defense is completely broken, and their offense can't keep up.  Washington State loves to throw the ball, and they did plenty of that against the Ducks, but what was surprising was that they managed to rush for six touchdowns with 280 yards on the ground.  Oregon clearly can't stop the run, and they're not going to do any better until they figure out a way to do so.  Clearly, Brady Hoke hasn't improved our defense at all, but the Ducks also lack the depth and personnel, so it's unfair to say whether Hoke has failed since he's not even into his first season.  Oregon's in a crisis, it's been a while, but this is not going to be Oregon's year, unless they drastically improve their defense.  Next week they play Washington, who've they haven't lost to in 12 years, but Washington will come into Autzen Stadium as a favorite for the first time in years.  Oregon will need a huge upset to keep that streak alive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
    		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/nate-wozniak.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Nate Wozniak&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
    		&lt;h4&gt;Nate Wozniak is HUGE!&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I didn't think if was possible, but the Huckin' Fuskies appear to be legit, they crushed Stanford.  Good lord!  Who'd of thunk that Steve Sarkisian leaving would be the best thing to happen to them.  Not only did they get a great coach in Chris Petersen, but they got rid of a drunk.  How well did he do at USC? --- Baylor should be ashamed of themselves.  Their new head coach Jim Grobe brought rape survivor Brenda Tracy to speak to them, and while she said the players were engaged, an assistant questioned her appearance and made her feel unwanted.  How disgusting!  They barely beat Iowa State 45-42.  That school is messed up, only interesting in winning.  You wonder why Penn State got in the position they did. --- Last week, I mentioned about Les Miles' poor clock management.  The next day, he was fired.  They should've fired him in the offseason when they wanted to.  His act got old pretty quick.  In the interim is Ed Orgeron, whom USC made a big mistake not keeping, hiring Steve Sarkisian instead.  How well did that work out for USC? --- What the heck is going on with Northwestern?  They've lost games to Western Michigan and Illinois State, but managed to beat Iowa.  Pretty perplexing to say the least. --- Five weeks into the season, and two of my picks for the playoffs already have two losses.  Florida State got embarrassed by Louisville and just lost today at home to North Carolina.  That's not national championship material.  Oklahoma's lost twice as well, but on the road to Houston and Ohio State.  They still have a shot, but have to run the table.  Pretty tough. Florida State, on the other hand, has two conference losses already.  They're out.  ---  Tennessee might be the most entertaining team to watch, as they've had to make comebacks in four of their five games this season to win, including three halftime deficits (one against Appalachian State!), and the other game against Ohio was a close one as well.  Against Georgia today, Tennessee completed a hail mary to win the game.  Safe to say, that type of grit will help them in the long run, especially for their next two games: Texas A&amp;amp;M and Alabama.  Those will be tough.  --- Indiana finally beat Michigan State in OT, 24-21.  The Hoosiers have come a long way, and they won with defense, a far cry from their high-scoring/no-defense past.  Props to the Hoosiers.  --- With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville (-2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tennessee (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Miami (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Liar Liar, Pant is on Fire</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; People lie, doesn't matter who you are.  But some people lie more than others.  This year, lying has become the new truth-telling, as the Republican candidate for President, whose name won't be mentioned, lies about, well, basically everything.  This is coming from a man who believes it's okay to lie and does so repeatedly and often as possible.  A man so deluded in himself that he complains a mass conspiracy every time someone tells him what he's saying is lying.  He even claims Ted Cruz as the biggest liar of all time with the nickname Lyin' Ted (to be fair, they are both ridiculous liars). With that said, tonight is the first Presidential debate, and one thing is for certain: this Idiot will frequently lie.  If a drinking game would be made out of it, all participants would die of alcohol poisoning. Here's a live look at lie upon lie upon lie..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton-donald-trump.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;The debate&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;One's great, one's stupid.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:03 PM - The first Presidential debate is started by moderator Leslie Holt, who announces it's sponspored by a non-partisan committee.  The Idiot previously thought the Democrats controlled it because the Falcons-Saints game is playing.  And here come Hillary in Red, and the Idiot with a blue tie.  Ironic colors for both of them.  Now we get the opening statement about acheiveing prosperity, mainly jobs.  Hillary Clinton first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:06 PM - Hillary talks first about the economy, and looking at the Idiot, he looks like a grumpy pompous ass while he's listening.  After acknowledging him, he showcases his ugly chin.  He's effin' ugly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:08 PM - And now for the Idiot.  He talks about stealing jobs, but he's done plenty of this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:10 PM - Hillary responds by calling the Idiot's economic plan as Trumped Up trickle down (I think), the most extreme ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:12 PM - The Idiot is talking about his small loan in 1975 of $1,000,000 dollars, which was much more in value than it is today.  With inflation, that's like $10,000,000.  Jenn just told me he's snifling a lot.  Now I noticed it.  He claims Hillary didn't do enough, but it's a too party street.  Hello?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:14 PM - The moderator asked him to actually answer the question, which he didn't answer.  Jenn's right, he's snifling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:15 PM - Hillary mentions the Recession as the primary reason for such jobs leaving.  After she mentioned the Idiots desire to profit off the collapse, he said &quot;That's business.&quot;  This is not business, it's being the President.  Idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:16 PM - The Idiot said he never said that global warming is a hoax.  It's all over his Twitter page.  Another case of &quot;I didn't say this even though I clearly did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump5.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:18 PM - The Idiot claims Obama's doubled the debt, but we were already in debt.  He asks Hillary why she hasn't come up with any solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:19 PM - Hillary has been thinking about it, but not for 30 years she joked.  It's not up all to her by herself.  He interrupts with remarks about NAFTA and then drinks some water.  Whoop dee doo.  What an Idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:21 PM - He keeps complaining about NAFTA, talking about devastation.  Hillary mentions him living in his own reality twisting her words.  He keeps interrupting about &quot;Is this Obama's fault?&quot;  He told Hillary he has no plan, but she mentions her plan clear and available in stores and at the airport, called Stronger Together.  He has no plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:23 PM - He's proud of the biggest tax plan cut since Ronald Reagan.  Reagan raised taxes.  He talks about regulations upon regulations, but regulations make companies play the level field.  He said Bigly two times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton4.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:24 PM - The Idiot says his things are Facts.  They are clearly not Facts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:25 PM - The Idiot says she shouldn't announce her plans to fight ISIS and claims she's been fighting ISIS her entire adult life.  Last time I checked, ISIS was founded in 2004.  Hillary is not 35.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:27 PM - The Idiot says 5 trillion dollars can't be brought in due to bureaucratic red tape.  That's likely a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:28 PM - The Idiot says &quot;Why not?&quot; as Hillary said she'll likely to be blamed for everything tonight.  Lester Holt told him to let her answer her question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump3.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:29 PM - Hillary talked about the Trump Loophole, a so-called name that his tax cuts would benefit his family.  He keeps interrupting her.  He wants his word even though it's her turn to talk.  What a loser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:30 PM - The Idiot claims she's all talk and no action.  He claims the worst economical revival since the Depression.  The economy hasn't been as bad since the depression.  Big hole to dump.  The moderator talks about his tax returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:31 PM - The Idiot claims a routine audit about his taxes.  He talks about his financial statement, but it's not a complete picture.  Release your taxes Idiot, it's clear you're hiding something.  The moderator mentions the IRS won't disallow him.  He complains about all the years under audit, it's because you're a fraud who's been sued so many times.  Now he's talking about her deleted emails, childish threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:34 PM - Hillary talks about the reasons he won't release his tax returns, and referred to as a Bait and Switch.  Who cares about her emails?  She talked about her emails, but interrupted again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:36 PM - The Idiot claims it was on purpose and illegal.  It was not illegal, just naive.  He claims you learn more about financial disclosures than tax returns.  But you don't get your tax rates.  Stupid!  He talks about knowing about money, but he filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy 6 times.  He claims our country in a mess and called us a third world country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:39 PM - Hillary wants to talk about his business and all the people he's stiffed for money.  His response: he didn't do a good job.  You still have to pay regardless of whether you like it or not.  It's called a contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:41 PM - The Idiot talks about words.  But that's all he is...words.  No action.  He said he paid the contractors but said he didn't paid them earlier.  He sniffles his nose again.  Now he talks about about making something under budget.  Sure, and I wear a bra.  The Moderator says we're really behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump4.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:44 PM - Now we're on to race issues.  Hillary's up first, talking about the tragedies in Tulsa and Charlotte.  Again, actual ideas about the criminal justice system and trust within the community, with both minoriites and the police.  It does need to be a mutual decision.  And yes, gun violence is a big factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:46 PM - Now the Idiot talks about Law and Order.  He talks about a large support of policemen.  He talks about African Americans and Hispanics living in hell, with 'thousands' of shootings in Chicago this year.  Again, he has no idea to stop this.  He blames Obama for all of this violence and wants racist Stop and Frisk policies.  He has no ideas to stop this.  Stop and Frisk was declared unconstitutional because of racist tendencies, but the Idiot claims the judge is biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton1.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:49 PM - The Idiot doesn't get it.  He keeps talking about Obama's presidency.  But violence is always been bad, it didn't start in 2009.  And he wants Stop and Frisk so cops can profile Blacks and Hispanics.  We need law and order without racial profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:51 PM - Hillary mentions how the Idiot has such a grim view of the inner cities.  She talks about having actual ideas, while all he can say is &quot;Law and Order.&quot;  All words.  If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:54 PM - Hillary talks about how everyone is implicitly racially biased.  Well said, it's not just a police issue.  We need officers retrained.  She mentioned mental health, which is always overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:55 PM - The Idiot claims the NRA are good people.  They are corrupt and only interested in gun.  Now he mentioned the term super-predator which she said years ago.  He claims stop and frisk brought murders down in NYC from 2,000 to 500.  That's bogus, and it had little impact.  She responds that crime is still down in NYC, he interrupts that it's not.  The Idiot's stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:58 PM - The Idiot claims Democrats are abusing African Americans for votes.  Republicans are trying to keep them from voting with voting right restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump2.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6:59 PM - Hillary got applause for saying she's preparing to be President.  Now he's asked about Obama's birthplace.  He's wasting his time talking about Hillary's role.  He doesn't want to talk about it.  She had nothing to do with that.  The moderator mentions he continued to claim he wasn't from Hawaii.  By the way, Obama did produce his birth certificate before he became President.  The Idiot is so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:02 PM - Hillary wisely points that the birther lie was racist, and tells the truth about what really happened.  It was how he started his career.  She talks about his lawsuits from the 70's about his racist behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton3.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary Clinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:05 PM - The Idiot is again lying about the Birther claim.  Hillary's team had nothing to start the Birther theory.  He's lying again.  Another section begins, security issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:06 PM - Once again, Hillary talks about two types of cyber criminals, including the Russian hacks of our countries organizations.  She's mentioned the Idiot's praise of Vladimir Putin.  He scoffs as if he doesn't praise Vladimir Putin.  She says it's one of their prime methods.  She mentions his asking for Putin to hack into her emails while he shakes his head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/donald-trump1.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Donald Trump&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Idiot!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:09 PM - Now the Idiot talks about more endorsements from Admirals and Navymen.  Sure...  And he talks about the political hacks running, probably because they support Hillary Clinton.  He's not answering the question, he's talking about the hacked emails themselves about Bernie Senders.  And ISIS is learning lots of internet stuff, including his words against Islam.  Once again, he's blaming the government for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:11 PM - More talking from Hillary about a plan to defeat ISIS, and obviously, she isn't going into the specifics, like the Idiot claims it.  And she knows we need to go after Baghdadi, the leader.  The moderator mentions the American citizens committing terrorist attacks.   American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:13 PM - The Idiot mentions Obama and Hillary creating ISIS.  Wrong.  He claims they created ISIS.  Wrong.  He talks about the oil we didn't take.  That's illegal.  He claims he never supported the Iraq War.  Wrong!  The Idiot said it's wrong that he supported the Iraq war, three times.  She mentioned Bush's agreement to leave Iraq.  Not Obama.  Bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton6.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary CLinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:16 PM - Hillary talks about allies, mentioning how the Idiot frequently insults Muslims.  He's so stupid.  Idiot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:17 PM - The Idiot talks about the Middle East is a total mess.  It's always been a mess.  He claims it's common sense that NATO needs to pay off.  He still isn't answering the question about home-grown terror or even mentioned it.  ISIS was formed in 2004, not in 2012.  Hello?  He wants to take them out quickly.  It's not an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:19 PM - He again denies he supported the war in Iraq.  He claims the record is not right, that he's always right.  He said, &quot;Yeah sure&quot; to Howard Stern.  Sean Hannity is a hack.  He told him his views after Howard Stern.  He's complaining about the media.  He's lying again.  The moderator mentions he's making mere judgments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:24 PM - Hillary's talking with experience, mentioning actual policies and getting things done.  The Idiot, not so much.  He's so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:26 PM - The Idiot says Obama is her president.  He says global warming is not the greatest threat.  He's the president of the United States.  And with NATO, he only cares about getting paid.  He's so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:31 PM - I'm getting worn out by this debate.  At least Hillary is smart enough to bring some intelligence to the conversation.  The Idiot keeps talking about her creating ISIS.  They didn't create ISIS.  He wants to help allies, but wants them to pay up.  He keeps talking about his business ability.  This is the Presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:33 PM - Now he's taking about Hillary's stamina.  He's arguing with the moderator over wording.  This has nothing to do with stamina.  Pretty sexist.  She mentions all her experience.  He claims it's bad experience.  We didn't give Iran 150 million dollars for nothing.  Stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/hillary-clinton5.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Hillary CLinton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:36 PM - The Idiot claims no one feels sorry for the things he said about Rosie O'Donnell.  He claims her ads are 'not nice' and 'not true.'  He's talking about the polls.  At last, the final statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7:37 PM - Hillary says the election is about us, to vote, not about them.  Same question for the Idiot, who talks about deporting people becoming citizens with some nonsense.  Finally, the debate's over.  Next up, the debates on October 9.  Thank god it's over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Four Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/quack.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Quack&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Darren Carrington putting new meaning to quacking like a duck after a touchdown&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Last year, Minnesota needed overtime to win at Colorado State, as Mitch Leidner led the Golden Gophers to a fourth quarter comeback before ultimately winning the game.  This time around, Minnesota led most of the game and were able to hold off Colorado State, with a 31-24 win, to finish their non-conference schedule 3-0.  Shannon Brooks, the team's leading rusher last year made his season debut after missing the first two games with a foot injury.  The Gophers were able to rush the ball for 243 yards in total, with all four touchdowns on the ground.  Their running game, plus a tough defense, makes the Gophers a tough out for their conference foes.  Also to note, Tai'yon Devers now has three tackles this year, all sacks causing fumbles that the Gophers recovered.  He knocked the crap out of Colorado State QB Collin Hill, knocking his helmet off in the process.  Making the most of his work to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that the non-conference schedule is over, Minnesota must make improvements in their passing game in order to contend.  They've made strides but need consistency from Leidner and the wide receivers.  The Big Ten West appears to be wide open, with last year's champ Iowa not playing as well as advertised.  They didn't look particularly good against Rutgers, winning 14-7.  Wisconsin and Nebraska look better than projected, with wins between LSU, Michigan State and Oregon between the two teams.  Minnesota realistically needs to win two out of those three matchups to contend, and with Nebraska and Wisconsin on the road, that task becomes tougher.  In the meantime, they need to win their first road game of the season (and first conference game) against Penn State, where the Governors Victory Bell is on the line.  A winnable game by all means but Beaver Stadium is a tough place to play, and Minnesota's only won two games there, the last win in 2003)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
        		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/EMU-protest.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;EMU&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
        		&lt;h4&gt;Eastern Michigan protesters after the game.&lt;/h4&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;    
    &lt;p&gt;Some things are more important than football, and that was clear in last night's game between Eastern Michigan and Wyoming, as protesters, upset with racist graffiti found on campus buildings earlier in the week, took to the field after the game chanting &quot;No Justice, No Peace.&quot;  I feel it's important to speak up about issues, and Eastern Michigan University, which supports the protesters rights, should be applauded for listening.  As long as the message isn't lost in translation and no violence comes as a result, this type of action is approved.  Since Colin Kaepernick stopped standing for the National Anthem, it's become a big topic, and unfortunately, those who don't support his actions don't understand what he (and others who have followed) are actually protesting.  That's another topic which I've previously discussed, but Eastern Michigan should be applauded for the way they've handled the response.  Talking about them just gives me an excuse to mention their town, Ypsilanti, which is up there with Kalamazoo as one of the most interesting city names in Michigan (and the United States in general).  It also means I've mentioned each directional Michigan school in just four weeks; Western Michigan, Central Michigan, and now, Eastern Michigan (in that order).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Oregon opened its conference schedule against Colorado, who's looked a lot better than in years past, but unfortunately for the Buffaloes, their starting quarterback Sefo Liufau is out with an ankle injury.  On the flip side, Royce Freeman didn't play for the Ducks, but they have plenty of talented running backs behind him; Tony Brooks-James, Kani Benoit and Taj Griffin.  The hype before the game were Oregon's new uniforms, featuring green shirts, white pants and orange socks and shoes, to resemble an actual duck.  Hard to believe they never thought of that all these years but it's a nice and clever look, I enjoyed their jerseys.  As for the game itself, Oregon's defense struggled in the first half to stop Colorado's offense, with backup QB Steven Montez looking like a stud in his first start.  Sefo Who?  The Autzen Stadium crowd, along with every Oregon fan watching, was stunned that Colorado led for most of the first half.  But much like the Buffaloes game last week against Michigan, where they similarly jumped out to a big first half lead, the Ducks came back to take the lead late in the third quarter with two turnovers leading to Oregon touchdowns.  But in the end, Colorado won 41-38 as Dakota Prukop threw his first interception of the year at the worst time to seal the loss for Oregon.  Safe to say, their defense is completely broken, as I feared would be the case.  This one will sting, but congrats to Colorado for finally getting a quality Pac-12 conference win, unfortunately it came against the Ducks.  Next up, a road trip to Washington State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Tennessee's Smokey uniforms.  Good or Bad?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Former Baylor President Kenneth Starr said today that former coach Art Briles was treatly unfairly in regards to Baylor's sexual assault scandal.  Regardless of whether that's true or not, Kenneth Starr treated Bill Clinton unfairly for prosecuting the sham Monica Lewinsky scandal which had no effect on the United States, yet felt it was the single most important issue in our country leading to an obviously politically motivated impeachment.  Shame on you, Kenneth Starr --- Tennessee wore their smokey gray uniforms against Florida.  I'm not quite sure if I like them or not, they stand as a complete contrast to their bright orange jerseys.  As for the game, they rallied from a 21-3 deficit to beat Florida 38-28.  Maybe they're better than I thought.  Not Top Ten good, but we'll see.  I've never had any issues with the Tennessee Volunteers, plus I have some family nearby, so I'll give them credit. --- LSU was this close to beating Auburn, with a miracle touchdown, but they didn't get the play off in time.  Classic Les Miles, always poor with clock management.  I can only chuckle. --- With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisconsin (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Who Killed JonBenét?</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Twenty years ago, the night after Christmas, six year old JonBenét Ramsey was found murdered in her home, in what has become a bizarre and fascinating case, from the rambling ransom note to the suspicion on the family, there are many odd things about the case that makes it unusual.  Yet after 20 years, no one really knows what happened.  Recently, a new investigator team, with new technology, reanalyzed the evidence and discussed their findings on a CBS special.  So with that all said, who killed JonBenét Ramsey?  Here are all my possible theories, complete with their likelihood of it happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jonbenet-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;JonBenét&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;JonBenét Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Mark Karr killed her.  He confessed to the crime, but no evidence linked him to it.  The likelihood that he killed her:  0%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burke Ramsey accidentally killed her.  Burke Ramsey, now 29, recently talked to Dr. Phil about the case, and he came across as socially awkward.  And despite the parents claim he was asleep at the time they called 911, a young voice was heard on the phone after Patsy thought she hung up the phone (she didn't) with updated technology, possibly saying “What did you find?”  I doubt a nine year old would intentionally kill his little sister, but if he was awake, why didn't they make that claim to begin with when he could’ve been awake without committing a crime?  In order for this theory to be true, someone needed to cover the crime, which his parents would have every reason to do.  Clearly, the ransom note was not written by Burke.  But at the same time, he apparently had a temper and hit her on the head with a golf club when she was four.  But that's not indicative of a killer; he was too young to understand.  They also found two dots on her back that might have matched train tracks, which he could’ve used, but doesn’t necessarily mean he did use them.  Also found at the scene was a bowl of pineapple and tea with Burke’s fingerprints, which becomes significant because JonBenét had undigested pineapple in her intestine when they found her.  It’s possible Burke hit her in the head with the flashlight over a pineapple squabble; the flashlight head perfectly fit the skull fracture they found, but it’s not the only reason to accidentally kill someone and anyone could’ve used it.  The likelihood of Burke killing her accidentally: 35%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patsy Ramsey killed her.  Two theories tie in to this scenario.  One: she got in a fit of rage, and two: she was mad at her husband and wanted him to pay for it.  The police had her submit five writing samples as they suspected she wrote the ransom note due to similar handwriting and found her fingerprints on the pad and pen.  The new investigators analyzed the note and believe a woman wrote it based on the language.  Her 911 call was incredibly off, as her apparent grief seemed fake, especially with the conversation overheard accidentally showed her incredibly calm.  And her and John refused to talk to the police for a while, not to mention the fact they had friends over while the crime scene was being investigated.  That in itself is a sign of trying to destroy evidence.  Something was never right with Patsy, and while it’s true she pushed JonBenét with all the pageantry stuff, it is possible she snapped from various reasons, whether it was jealousy or perfectionism.   The likelihood of Patsy killing her: 40%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/burke-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Burke&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Burke Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Ramsey killed her.  John Ramsey acted weird, running straight for the basement when the police told him they needed to search the house top to bottom.  And he planned to leave shortly after they found JonBenét deceased.  That seems a bit odd, but wouldn't explain the ransom note that made him the target.  At the very least, he was involved in the so-called cover-up.  The likelihood he killed her: 5%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patsy Ramsey hired someone to kill her.  The DNA found on JonBenét’s body did not match her immediate family.  That ruled them out as official suspects, but that doesn't mean they weren't involved in her death.  Assuming Patsy wrote the note, she could have had someone enter the house to kill JonBenét, but if money was the object, why wasn't she actually kidnapped?  Perhaps a struggle ensued and the hired killer took things too far by striking her while Patsy wrote the ransom note.  On the other hand, the broken glass theory seemed unlikely, someone probably would've heard it and cobwebs were found intact, as the window was allegedly broken by John months prior.  There was no break-in, so someone else who may have entered the house had to have been let in.  It makes no sense for them to enter through the basement window based on the evidence.  Patsy is the most likely to do this.  The lack of footprints outside in the snow is harder to get explain under this theory, but everything else potentially works.  The probability of Patsy hiring someone to kill her: 15%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;John Ramsey hired someone to kill her.  It’s highly unlikely that this is a possibility as John Ramsey had little motive to kill JonBenét, but you never know, he could've had a double life and seeked an escape, but that would require killing the whole family.  The likelihood of John hiring someone to kill her: 2%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A complete stranger killed her.  There are plenty of sexual predators out there, and one of them could've easily slipped in the door and committed the crime.  Of course, without no forced entry, the only way this is possible is if the door was unlocked.  Otherwise, there would've been evidence of a break-in.  But anything is possible.  There are plenty of people that would have had an unhealthy lust for her since she was in beauty pageants all prettied up.  But why write a ransom note inside with the exact amount of John’s bonus?  Who knew that number besides the family itself.  And since the ransom note suggests a cover-up, why cover up a complete stranger.  The likelihood of a complete stranger killing her: 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/patsy-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Patsy&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Patsy Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of things to consider when making the determination as to who killed JonBenét.  There was no break-in or footprints (they found one but not conclusive), which highly suggests the killer was already in the house.  Though it’s possible a stranger found a key and entered the house without a break-in, it doesn't completely explain the ransom note.  A true ransom note wouldn't have been written as long nor on pad of paper found in the house.  Even more damaging to the legitimacy of the ransom note was that JonBenét was found dead in the basement.  That's not a kidnapping.  This further suggests that her killer was one of her family members.  But which member was it?  Burke, Patsy or John?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s little evidence to conclude that John Ramsey was the killer.  The ransom note was targeted at him and didn't sound like he wrote it.  He appears to be a family loving businessman and nothing else.  The motive isn't there.  That just leaves Patsy and Burke as the two most likely perpetrators.  Both had the ability to kill JonBenét, whether intentional or not.   There’s certainly a reason to believe a cover up occurred, as a grand jury voted to indict John and Patsy for charges related to her murder, but ultimately the DA declined to press charges.  But who had more of a motive to have a crime covered up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of reasons to believe Burke was the killer.  He acted bizarre over the whole ordeal, and his parents apparently lied about him being asleep at the time they called 911.  They spent their lives protecting him and wanting him to have a normal life.  Plus with a tendency to have a temper, it was possible to hit her in a rage.  It would perfectly explain the ransom note as a means to bring attention away from him.  But at the same time, any awkwardness shown in his psychiatry visits doesn’t necessarily suggest that said awkwardness was due to killing her.  Maybe he witnessed the attack that left JonBenét Ramsey dead, and the reason the parents said he was asleep was to keep him from testifying.  That is also possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the most likely suspect is Patsy Ramsey.  The way she acted during the 911 call was not what you'd expect from someone who lost a child.  She sounded too calm and likely would've shown a tad more emotion if it was Burke rather than herself.  She pushed JonBenét hard with the pageantry and perhaps got jealous of the attention she received and snapped.  She invited friends over while police were investigating the crime scene and wouldn't speak to the police, speaking to CNN first.  Even then, the way she spoke of JonBenét after she died struck me as someone who killed her, rather than someone protecting her son who killed her.  She said things like “I loved that child,” which lacks empathy to me.  John Ramsey was a loving husband and would’ve easily protected his wife if said attack was not intentional.  There certainly are problems with this theory, but it makes more sense than Burke being the killer.  Sure, Burke was weird, and still is weird, but he could've always been like that.  He appeared to be jealous of the attention JonBenét got, but that didn’t mean he actually killed her.  Plus, he was nine years old.  He would’ve never been criminally charged with her death, as he was too young.  But Patsy would’ve faced murder/manslaughter charges if she was in fact the killer.  She would’ve face prison time and that would’ve destroyed the family fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/john-ramsey.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;John&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;John Ramsey&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing for certain is that the family never wanted this case solved.  They used their money and influence to keep the investigation grounded, and did everything else to wipe out and destroy evidence.  Had the police officers and FBI had not messed up the initial investigation, chances are, the crime would’ve been solved 20 years ago.  In this essence, all three Ramsey’s were involved in her death and only have themselves to blame.  Protecting themselves at the expense of JonBenét is sad.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Skittles - A Poor Analogy to Describe Humanity</title>
        <description>&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Today, Donald Trump Jr., son of the racist bigot Idiot whom he's named after, again proved that racism is learned, much like his racist father and grandfather, by making this ridiculous analogy about Syrian refugees: &quot;If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you.  Would you take a handful?&quot;  Aside from being moronic and overly simplistic, statements like this are a perfect example of why racial profiling is flat out wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/Skittles.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Skittles&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Skittles, just candy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Mars, Incorporated, the makers of Skittles pointed out, &quot;Skittles are candy; refugees are people.&quot;  Anyone who wants to treat human beings as candy is purely stupid and ignorant.  Skittles are all made the same way, have the same ingredients, the only difference is their color and taste.  But even amongst those flavors, each flavor is made the same and are supposed to be the same.  Two yellow Skittles are the same.  Two red Skittles are the same as well.  Human beings on the other hand, are complex individuals with unique DNA, personality and other characteristics that makes them one unique human being (twins aside, but that's an exception to the rule, not a commonality).  A human being with brown hair, white skin and green eyes is always going to be different from another human being with brown hair, white skin and green eyes due to the complexity of human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating people like candy is the perfect metaphor for racial profiling.  By definition, racial profiling is judging people based on characteristics.  Most times, it's a person's negative characteristics that's used for racial profiling.  It doesn't matter how good a person is, to some, it's better to assume they might be bad to catch the bad ones than it is to treat them all as good and let a bad one get through.  This might work with candy; if a bad batch is made, you can simply throw it out and make a new batch, but this doesn't work with human beings.  You can't simply recycle or throw away human beings like you would with candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of a few cannot be used to judge an entire group of people.  It's not true about candy nor is it excuse to discriminate against other human beings.  Yet some claim it's the only way to stop terrorism.  A better way is to do what we currently do, judge each person individually, not judge them based on perceived characteristics which may or may not be true about said individual. That way, a person can be judge by all of their characteristics, not just their appearance.  Unfortunately, some people will often harbor negative feelings towards someone solely based on the color of their skin.  In the case of Syrian refugees, it's based solely on their Islamic faith, which some people make their decision primarily based on skin color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's always the chance someone falls through the cracks; there's nothing we can do to stop that.  But that doesn't mean we can't deny rights to the many that are good hard-working human beings.  After all, the defining characteristic of a person with the intent to commit a crime is not their skin color, nationality nor religion, it's their intent to commit a crime.  Racial profiling does nothing but lead people to only be on the lookout for a certain group of people.  Any person is capable of committing a crime.  But while racists will judge a terrorist like Ahmad Rahami of being representative of all Muslims, these same people will not make the same comparison for terrorists like Dylann Roof to all white people.  To them, a good Muslim is worse than a bad Christian.  But that is simply not true.  The people these racists will assume as Muslims may not be even Muslim as all, the gentleman who spotted Ahmad Rahami shares a similar skin complexion, but is a Sikh, whom share no connection with Muslims whatsoever.  Racial profiling is not only wrong but ineffective, since skin color doesn't define a person's religion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next time you want to eat some Skittles, just remember they're just candy.  Mars Incorporated does the best it can to ensure the quality of their product.  It's entirely possible a stale Skittle makes it in the pile, but it isn't likely to happen.  That doesn't mean you should never eat Skittles again or throw out every bag of Skittles in your cabinet because one might make you sick in your stomach.  This wouldn't be acceptable with candy, and this is not the way Syrian refugees should be treated to, as they are human beings with far more complexities than your average piece of candy.  So while Donald Trump Jr. should probably stay away from Skittles as he will likely be paranoid that someone will give him poisoned candy over his stupid and ignorant comments, the rest of us can enjoy candy and know it's just that, candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>College Football Week Three Thoughts</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Week 3, unlike the week before, featured a lot of challenging match-ups, and for the first time ever, the Top 3 ranked teams in the AP poll play on the road against other ranked teams.  Alabama at Ole Miss, Florida State at Louisville and Ohio State at Oklahoma.  Safe to say, champions are made here.  Other plenty of entertaining games abound.  So what happened on Week 3?  Here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/buffaloes.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Colorado Buffaloes&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Gotta love the Colorado Buffaloes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action started early on Saturday, with Lamar Jackson and Louisville hosting Florida State in a Top Ten match-up.  But by halftime, this game was anything but, as Louisville completely obliterated Florida State at home with a 63-20 romp.  Lamar Jackson proved to be the real deal, with five touchdowns (four rushing) against the Seminoles, as they made Florida State look just as bad as Charlotte and Syracuse.  Safe to say Lamar Jackson will now be the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy (with apologies to Christian McCaffrey).  Florida State made an impressive comeback against Ole Miss the first week but Louisville never stopped.  Very impressive.  The only thing I didn't like were their chrome helmets.  Aside from the butterfly on the back to honor hometown legend Muhammad Ali, I didn't like their helmets especially the white logo.  But at the end of the day, Florida State lost ugly, just like they did at the Rose Bowl against Marcus Mariota and the Oregon Ducks.  Ouch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/bison.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;North Dakota State Bison&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;North Dakota State Bison quarter Easton Stick.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great match-up was Iowa vs. North Dakota State.  It's rare to call an FBS-FCS match-up exciting but as five time defending FCS champs, North Dakota State is not your typical FCS team.  It was certainly a big gamble for them to play at Top 15 team like Iowa, but North Dakota State played like a Big Ten team, pulling off the upset 23-21, with a field goal as time expired to win it.  North Dakota State played a bruising style of game, wearing Iowa out in the end, scoring the last nine points of the game.  North Dakota State became the first FCS team since Eastern Washington upset Oregon State in 2010 to beat a ranked FBS team.   Especially impressive against a team that made the Rose Bowl last year.  I'e always been impressed with the Bison from my time at Minnesota, and they could easily contend in the FBS if they wanted to.  They've won 6 straight against the FBS which says a lot, and they certainly aren't afraid of anybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Appreciate it &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/WinTheDay&quot;&gt;@WinTheDay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;✊ &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/SF27?src=hash&quot;&gt;#SF27&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/po22PweKtf&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/po22PweKtf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nebraska Football (@HuskerFBNation) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HuskerFBNation/status/777206703267786752&quot;&gt;September 17, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great match-up for Oregon as they faced Nebraska on the road in their first real test of the year, as well as Dakota Prukop's first challenge as FBS QB.  Before the game, Oregon laid some flowers at the 27 yard line in honor of their late punter Sam Foltz (who wore #27).  Very classy.  Way to go Oregon.  As for the game itself, it was a back and forth battle, but unfortunately, Nebraska won by 3.  Oregon had their chances, and their decision to go for 2 after each touchdown (they went 1-5 overall) was definitely puzzling to say the least, but you win some and lose some.  Oregon certainly plays bold as Mike Riley put it, but those types of missed opportunities along with a lot of penalties tilted the game in Nebraska's favor.  Dakota Prukop played well given the circumstances, but Royce Freeman got hurt on the first drive and didn't come back.  Despite the loss of Freeman, they didn't miss a beat with their running game.  Good game, but not the result Oregon wanted.  Up next, their conference opener against a much improved Colorado team.  Speaking of the Buffaloes...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Michigan played Colorado in a game that would've had no hype if not for the back and forth banter between the two schools.  Jim Harbaugh, hard-ass coach of Michigan with no sense of humor, refused to release his teams depth chart, believing in secrecy.  Colorado, in a humorous attempt to combat Michigan's lack of depth chart, released their own depth chart, with the likes of Elmer Fudd, Austin Powers and The Dude, which can only be described as hilarious and clever.  Possibly the funniest thing I've seen a team do, who cares if Jim Harbaugh found it unfunny.  In fact, their twitter feed as a whole was quite hilarious.  As for the game itself, Colorado played fairly well considering their recent past and playing Michigan at home.  They jumped out to a lead, but Michigan stormed back, winning 45-28.  They're not the joke they were when they entered the Pac-12, and Oregon shouldn't take them lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In case you haven&amp;#39;t seen this week&amp;#39;s depth chart.  What and who is in your favorite position? &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoBuffs?src=hash&quot;&gt;#GoBuffs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/19qUmVyO6P&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/19qUmVyO6P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Colorado Football (@RunRalphieRun) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RunRalphieRun/status/775718135315980288&quot;&gt;September 13, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penn State did the inappropriate thing and honored Joe Paterno, fifty years after his first game, or forty years after he was first allegedly told that disgraced assistant Jerry Sandusky was molesting little boys.  Coaching aside, Joe Paterno did nothing and many suffered.  Some Penn State fans obsession with honoring Joe Paterno is absolutely sickening. --- Speaking of inappropriate, in last night's match-up between Rice and Baylor, the Rice marching band 'honored' Baylor's recent controversy by forming IX, a reference to Title IX.  Seems Rice is known for parody marches.  They certainly need something since Baylor easily won 38-10 ---  This week, Clemson was on the right side of a boneheaded play as South Carolina State kick returner Ahmaad Harris inexplicably handed the ball to a referee without taking a knee.  Clemson pounced on the ball to score a touchdown.  Clemson won the game 59-0 in a game that was shortened by six minutes as the two agreed to a mercy rule (to shorten said game) --- Alabama finally solved its Ole Miss problem, needing a 21-point comeback to win 48-43.  I hate Nick Saban.  I hate Lane Kiffin.  And now that Steve Sarkisian joined the staff, I hate him too.  --- Western Michigan got paid $210,000 to play Illinois and subsequently won 34-10.  They're 2-0 against the Big Ten this year, that's what I call highway robbery.  Double salute to the departed John Saunders.  --- USC is 1-2 for the first time since Pete Carroll's first year.  Another reason why USC is stupid and pathetic.  Every year it's the same story of what great talent they have all because they're USC.  And they never live up to the expectations and lose.  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alabama&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ohio State (+2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Louisville (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clemson (-2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stanford (+1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Houston (-1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michigan State (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Washington (NR)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florida State (-8)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now as a bonus, in honor of Colorado's fake depth chart, here is my fake depth chart consisting of some of the pathetic people out there, for a team I call &quot;The Basket of Deplorables.&quot;  Starring who else but the Republican Presidential Candidate as starting Quarterback, his biggest ass kisser Chris Christie as fullback and handing the ball off to his favorite dictator in Vladimir Putin as running back, you'll be completed disgusted with this depth chart.  Thanks Colorado for the fun.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Worst Politicians Currently in Office</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;

    }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Let's be honest, politics is dumb at its core and politicians are terrible.  Currently, Congress has an approval rating of about 10% or so.  Plenty of our current politicians couldn't figure their way out of a paper bag, much less pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation.  No matter who's elected President, Congress will always find ways to screw things up and stop real progress from happening.  With that said, here are the 15 worst members of Congress, and as an added bonus, the 5 worst Governors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Worst Congressmen (and Congresswomen)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Joe Wilson&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;15. Joe Wilson - South Carolina House of Representative - 2nd District&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A rude and racist congressman who once yelled at Obama &quot;You lie!&quot; while Obama gave a speech on health care, Joe Wilson proved what a bozo he really is. Of course, Joe Wilson's racist approach to Obama was filled with hate and lies, as contrary to what Joe Wilson claimed, Obamacare does not provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants.  Democrats rebuked him, but Republicans protected him for something they'd complain about if a Democrat did the same thing to a Republican President.  Hypocrisy strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Mike Lee&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;14. Mike Lee - Utah Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you need to know about Mike Lee is that he's Ted Cruz's sidekick.  Plus he single handedly stopped a bill giving financial relief to Flint, Michigan by claiming &quot;They have plenty of money.&quot;  If there's anyone willing to follow Ted Cruz, it's Mike Lee.  Despite lacking major recognition, that alone gets Mike Lee on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Mark Sanford&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;13. Mark Sanford - South Carolina House of Representative - 1st District&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As former Governor, Sanford lied to his people by claiming he wanted to take a hike on the Appalachians, only to go legally missing for six days in 2009 before turning up in Argentina with his mistress.  Yet years later, after his time as Governor ended, South Carolinians in the first district forgave him by electing him back into political office.  Surely, they wouldn't feel the same way about Bill Clinton's affair…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/lindsey-graham.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Lindsey Graham&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Lindsey Graham&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;12. Lindsey Graham - South Carolina Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man John McCain once called his illegitimate son due to their military based similarities, Lindsey Graham is far less likeable and hasn't accomplished nearly as much as John McCain. If it were up to people like Graham and McCain, we'd spend all eternity in the Middle East fighting their wars, we don't have a clue of how to make things stable without our intervention.  It's no wonder Lindsey Graham couldn't even get 1% Republican support in the Presidential race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/marco-rubio.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Marco Rubio&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;11. Marco Rubio - Florida Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His values are decent but Marco Rubio is as untrustworthy and unreliable as they come.  He barely showed up to work as Senator, didn't want to run for re-election, but was pushed back in by external forces wanting to keep his seat and the Senate Majority Red.  His Presidential candidacy was predictable and uninspiring, going as far to insult Donald Trump's hand size.  Not the right message from someone who actually has Presidential material, but blew it acting like a child and ultimately lost his home state badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/steve-scalise.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Steve Scalise&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Steve Scalise&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Steve Scalise - Louisiana House of Representative - 1st District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Scalise, one of the highest ranking members in Congress, once spoke to a white supremacist group looking for support, claiming he didn't know he was speaking to a white supremacist group founded by the infamous David Duke.  He should've known better than associating himself with David Duke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jim-jordan.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Jim Jordan&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Jim Jordan&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9. Jim Jordan - Ohio House of Representative - 4th District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of two ultra conservative voices on the Benghazi committee, who didn't think their wasteful investigation into Hillary Clinton for the third time did enough to blame her, so he and fellow extremist Freedom Caucus member Mike Pompeo added to the Republican report nonsense blaming Hillary for something she didn't do.  Jim Jordan makes this list as the Chairman of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/rand-paul.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Rand Paul&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Rand Paul&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Rand Paul - Kentucky Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good old Aqua Buddha, the pretend Libertarian, who fights for privacy rights yet thinks the Government can force a woman to remain pregnant, Rand Paul is a fake Libertarian wannabe who once called Obama gay for supporting gay marriage (obviously a homophobic slur meaning 'stupid,' not a belief Obama is actually gay).  Rand Paul had such little confidence of winning the Presidential election that he forced Kentucky to change its rules to allow him to run for Senate as a backup plan.  He obviously didn't make it past Iowa, as not surprisingly, Rand Paul couldn't convince his Dad's followers to support him like they did Ron Paul since he's a phony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/joni-ernst.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Joni Ernst&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Joni Ernst&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. Joni Ernst - Iowa Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joni Ernst, just elected Senator, scares the crap out of me.  Her looks, her actions and goofy smile makes her creepy.  Anyone who thinks Obama is a dictator but ignores Donald Trump's love for dictators and desire to be a dictator doesn't know what the word dictator means.  As someone who claims her experience castrating pigs would make her perfect for cutting &quot;pork&quot; (wasteful spending), I have no clue why the fair-minded people in Iowa voted for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Trey Gowdy&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Trey Gowdy - South Carolina House of Representative - 4th District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current head of the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, also known as the Hillary Clinton Witch Hunt, Trey Gowdy, who looks like a ghost, accomplished nothing with the Republican witch hunt, wasting millions of dollars to find absolutely nothing new, creating a report all by themselves so the Democrats couldn't say anything nice.  Even worse, he awkwardly questioned Martin Shkreli for his purchase of the secret Wu-Tang Clan album which led to a bizarre back-and-forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/jim-inhofe.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Jim Inhofe&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Jim Inhofe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Jim Inhofe - Oklahoma Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man whose brain must be made of snowballs, as Jim Inhofe, who infamously brought a snowball to a congressional meeting on climate change to make the claim that the existence of snow disproves climate change altogether.  Only an idiot like him would come to that conclusion, clearly there are 4 seasons throughout the year due to the Earth's axis tilt, and it's going to be summer somewhere on planet Earth.  Even worse, Inhofe claims religion as the sole reason it's a hoax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/steve-king.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Steve King&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Steve King&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Steve King - Iowa House of Representative - 4th District&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve King, King of the Anti-Hispanics claiming to be the King of Anti-Illegal Immigration, is a hateful scumbag who recently claimed that only white people have contributed to Western Society.  For someone like Steve King, immigrants aren't livestock but human beings, and treating them like animals is inhumane.  Steve King is the worst member of the House of Representatives, frequently making racist and homophobic remarks, as well as inflammatory remarks about President Obama, claiming he's a Muslim savior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/tom-cotton.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Tom Cotton&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Tom Cotton&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Tom Cotton - Arkansas Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely in his first term as Senator, Tom Cotton, the youngest member in the Senate, led the way to trying to interfere with the Iran deal by sending a letter to the Supreme Leader of Iran with 46 other Republican senators telling Iran any deal made with Obama can be taken away and that he had no authority to make such a deal.  This type of action is illegal and should be criminal to interfere with a deal they aren't negotiating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot; style=&quot;float: left&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mitch-mcconnell.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Mitch McConnell&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mitch McConnell&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Mitch McConnell - Kentucky Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Majority leader who promised Republicans would accomplish more with control yet has accomplished nothing but play games and rewrite the rules.  For a man who once made it his mission to make Obama a one-term President, Mitch McConnell refuses to hold a vote on a replacement for Justice Scalia, inventing rules of 'the American people need to vote for a new justice' (not their choice) while blaming Obama for his actions (not accepting Justice Alito in 2006 is not the same as not holding a vote on Justice Alito in 2006).  A terrible Senate Leader, the Democrats need to take majority back.  Even worse, he takes credit for something he had no involvement in (a rising economy which Republicans have consistently fought against).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;blog-pic&quot;&gt;
		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ted-cruz.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Ted Cruz&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Ted Cruz - Texas Senator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt the worst Senator of modern times, rivaling the infamous Joseph McCarthy as the worst of all time, a selfish degenerate who only thinks of himself and would have no problem destroying the very fabric of this nation just to get his way, as shown with his Government shutdown.  It's very clear that Ted Cruz lives to oppose everything Obama has done, he even voted against a bill once Obama supported it.  This man is the most hateful person ever, believing everything should be about Christianity, trampling over everyone who's not Christian.  Ted Cruz is well disliked by both parties and after his speech at the RNC, will have the biggest target on his back in 2018 when he's up for reelection.  This man is a cancer and needs to go now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Worst Governors&lt;/h1&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/chris-christie.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Chris Christie&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Chris Christie&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Chris Christie - New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Christie, the biggest opportunistic blowhard of them all, first doing the right thing by working with Obama for assistance with Hurricane Sandy, then complaining about Democrats after receiving negative comments from fellow Republicans, all to further his Presidential ambitions.  Chris Christie only cares about himself and will do anything, bashing Donald Trump during his own campaign but became Trump's biggest ass-kisser after he dropped out, desperate to be Vice President (which he didn't get). His mock trial of Hillary at the RNC was stupid and childish.  It's no wonder the people of New Jersey were so angry that they asked him to resign after endorsing Trump, in addition to their floundering economy.  And with the Bridgegate scandal hurting him despite his claims he knew nothing about it, chances are that's probably a lie based on his bullying ways.  Guilty of Not Guilty of being involved in Bridgegate?  Guilty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Rick Snyder&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Rick Snyder - Michigan&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, has led the city of Flint into a complete hell-hole thanks to his decision to change their water source for cost-cutting measures, all while refusing to spend a few extra bucks to treat lead-tainted water.  If that isn't bad enough, two years later, he has refused to do anything about it, ignoring the problem until the media started complaining.  He has refused to accept any responsibility for any of this, blaming Democrats for targeting him.  He even challenged himself to drink their lead-tainted water for 30 days straight, but never followed through, instead traveling overseas in an obvious attempt to appear reasonable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;

		&lt;img src=&quot;/img/mike-pence.jpg&quot; data-toggle=&quot;tooltip&quot; title=&quot;Mike Pence&quot; class=&quot;image block img-responsive&quot; /&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Mike Pence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Mike Pence - Indiana&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Governor of Indiana, an abortion hating religious freedom law passing homophobe, is the only person stupid enough to accept an offer to be Donald Trump's running mate.  He even made this following quote about Donald Trump: &quot;Not since Ronald Reagan in my lifetime has there been a man or woman at the national level who has heard the frustrations and the aspirations of the American people the way (Trump) does.&quot;   Despite this, he gave the worst endorsement in the history of endorsements to Ted Cruz, which helped lead to Ted Cruz's demise in his home state of Indiana, instead spending more time praising Donald Trump.  His handling of Indiana's religious freedom bill, which got scrapped, is a prime example of how stupid he truly is, unaware of what the word 'discrimination' means.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h4&gt;Sam Brownback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Sam Brownback - Kansas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Brownback presided over some of the most extreme tax cuts in history, costing Kansas millions of jobs and destroying their economy, in the name of Tea Party based experiments that have clearly failed.  Despite Kansas Republicans favoring a moderate Democrat to defeat him in the last election, the voters of Kansas re-elected this economy wrecking bozo.  Turns out the great experiment has been a complete catastrophe to everyone except for Brownback himself.  He also removed gay rights in the public sector, claiming it would help military veterans somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1. Pat McCrory - North Carolina&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat McCrory is a lunatic who thinks bathroom use is the most important thing needing to be fixed in North Carolina, as he has waged war against all the LGBT, believing no city in his state can give them the human rights they deserve while claiming transgenders don't exist, don't have any rights, and are likely to be sexual predators targeting women in bathrooms. If that's not bad enough, he blames it on Charlotte for giving the LGBT the rights they deserve.  He doesn't care how much money he's costing the state, especially after the NBA yanked the All-Star game from Charlotte, instead continuing his war in the bathroom.  Instead, he's willing to sue the Government for protecting basic human rights.  It's not common sense, it's discriminatory.  Pat McCrory, who clearly is using this war to get Republican support during an Election year, needs to be voted out.  The state of North Carolina deserves better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
