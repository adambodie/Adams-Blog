<p> I woke up Sunday morning, as I usually do, looking at my iPhone to check the news.  Like millions of others who woke up today, I was disgusted and saddened to hear that 49 people had been killed in a terrorist attack at an Orlando gay nightclub, Pulse.  Like most, I despise terrorism and hate whenever it occurs.  But stopping terrorism here in the United States and the world requires our nation and our allies to come together.  But instead, we have our Republican congressmen and wannabe congressmen furthering dividing us and claiming defeating Terrorism is as easy as saying three little words...</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/orlando.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Stand strong with Orlando." class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Stand strong with Orlando.  That's what love is all about.  Not words.</h4>
</div>
	<p>Stopping terrorism cannot be defined simply by the words you use to describe it.  So when Donald Trump and his idiot Republican friends suggest that President Obama and Hillary Clinton need to use three little words in order to stop it, it is both ridiculous and counterproductive to believe that the United States and our world powers are going to win the war on terror simply by uttering the phrase "Radical Islamic Terrorist."  No time in the history of the world has anything been changed simply by uttering a phrase.  It involves actions and cooperation, not divide, to defeat evil.  Obama is aware of this, and doesn't need to say it just to defeat them</p>
	<p>Terrorism is terrorism, attacks designed to scare and hurt many and all who love.  There are all type of terrorism, and Obama correctly identified the attacks as terror and hate, but the Republicans think that doesn't do anything.  They claim Obama is soft and doesn't have a clue about what's going on, as if the only way to stop these attacks is to utter the phrase "Radical Islamic Terrorist."  There is no need to use this phrase, and in reality, causes more harm than good, as anti-Islam Republican's have long been part of the problem, not the solution.</p>
	<p>Terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda claim to be driven by Islam, but all they really want is power.  They merely use the teachings of Islam and pervert them to justify their actions, even though they're not driven by religion, but rather power.  So to suggest that these terrorist groups are Radical Muslims is in insult to those who preach Islam.  As Muhammad Ali, who recently passed away stated, "True Muslims know the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion."  So using these three little words defeats the whole purpose of stopping terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda; rather it legitimizes their beliefs that the West is at war with Islam as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>True Muslims know the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion.<footer>Muhammad Ali</footer></blockquote>
	<p>After the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush proclaimed that "we are not at war with Islam," and this is the way it should be.  But Republicans today, too eager to blame the Muslims for everything and full of hate, are the ones clearly at war with Islam, willing to use them as a scapegoat.  That's why they insist that we utter three little words to describe them, as if that alone will make a difference in our fight.  It's no surprise that their words are being used by Terrorists to convince them to join their groups.  To a society that's more Islamophobic by the day with those who preach Islam being targeted for their religion and being mocked as 'terrorists,' the Republicans are making things worse by uttering those three little words and targeting Muslims as a whole, implying a religious war that doesn't exist.  The effect they have on their constituents is clear in that regard.</p>
	<p>We will never win the war on terror here while Republicans keep dividing us and encouraging hatred against Muslims, or groups that are mistaken for Muslims based on their appearance, i.e. Sikhs, Buddhists.  For every major attack committed by someone who claims support or has actual ties to terrorist groups like ISIS or al-Qaeda, there are hundreds of people here hurling insults at Muslims, attacking them for their appearance and looking at them with disgust.  As Republican's are largely interested in political power themselves by attracting the white population that hates minorities, Muslims included, it can be said that they are happy with their war on Islam.  That's why it's important for them to use three little words.</p>

		<h4>Obama criticized Trump for those three little words.  Didn't stop Terrorism when Obama uttered them.</h4>
</div>
	<p>Terrorism is something we all must stop, and childish name calling is not going to be the difference between winning and losing that battle.  It's never accomplished anything more than encourage those to continue their fight.  We win our fights with action and collaboration, not through petty words and mudslinging.  So while the Republicans live in a fantasy world where words wins battle, anyone with an actual brain knows how our greatest battles have been actually won.</p>
	<p>When it's all said and done, leadership, more than anything, is what holds us together and defeats evil.  Instead, we have Republican's playing the blame game, refusing to accept anything Obama even says as true and criticizing him every chance they have, even over the littlest things.  This lack of leadership and obstructionism is sickening and demeaning to those who have died.  They feign their condolences but clearly are more interested in attacking Obama for his choice of words.  This is not how we get things done.  We accomplish things through actions, not words.</p>
