<p>Selection Sunday has arrived and gone, and now March Madness is set to begin, as 68 teams enter the NCAA Tournament, only one will win the National Championship. Who will take down the nets? How many upsets will ruin people’s brackets everywhere? Which 12 seeds will pull off the upsets? And will this finally be the year a #1 seed loses to a 16th seed?</p>

	<h4>I like Dillon Brooks' spark.  He's got a fierce attitude and plays like it too.</h4>
</div>

<p>I’ll start off by congratulating my Oregon Ducks for finishing as a top seed for the first time ever.  Didn’t expect much of them this season, but they have been very impressive, and are playing really hot right now, demolishing Utah and whomping Arizona (except for that last minute of regulation) in the Pac-12 Tournament.  They have some impressive players with freakish talents; Elgin Cook, Dillon Brooks, Tyler Dorsey and the amazing Chris Boucher, 2nd in the nation in blocked shots per game, yet has the ability to make three pointers.  Impressive for a kid who’s only played basketball for four years of his life (he’s 22).  So to answer the last question, no, this won’t be the year the #1 seed loses to a #16 seed.</p>

<p>I haven’t followed College Basketball too much this season, but there doesn’t appear to be a heavy favorite to win it all.  It appears to be wide open as to who wins it all.  The Number 1 Seeds, Kansas (#1 overall), North Carolina, Virginia and Oregon, the Number 2 Seeds Villanova, Xavier, Michigan State and Oklahoma, and so on.  As an Oregon fan, I’m fortunate Michigan State didn’t wind up in their bracket.  They should’ve been a Number 1 over Virginia.  Unfortunately for Virginia, Michigan State is in their bracket, having lost to them in the Tournament two years in the row.  Two rules I tend to follow apply here: never bet against Michigan State (I correctly predicted them to make the Final Four last year as a 7-Seed) and never bet on Villanova (having missed out on the Sweet Sixteen two years in a row despite a very high seed).</p>

<p>My favorite part of the NCAA Tournament has always been the upsets.  Correctly picking the 12-5 Upset, anyone below that seed capable of making America’s brackets burst, you name it.  This year, none of the 12 seeds particularly stand out as likely upsets.  Still, as a Minnesota Golden Gopher graduate, I can tell you that Minnesota lost to South Dakota State but beat Maryland.  So I’m going to make that my upset pick, though I’m not very confident on it.  And keep in my mind Golden Gophers had a poor season (beating Maryland was their only impressive win).  I also like 11 seed Gonzaga to upset 6 seed Seton Hall.  Despite a disappointing season for the Zags, they still have a talented squad.  Another upset I like is 10 seed VCU over 7 seed Oregon State.  First off, congrats to the Beavers for finally making it after 26 years.  They’ve been impressive enough with Coach Tinkle doing a great job with limited talent, and of course, Gary Payton II is just like his dad.  With that said, the Beavers weren’t that consistent and seeded too high in my opinion, so I’m picking VCU.  It could go either way, but then again, so can any of the 8-9 games, but those are never considered upsets.</p>

<p>Another part I enjoy is seeing who the last teams in and the first teams out are.  I thought Wichita State would have been higher but Vanderbilt, Michigan and especially Tulsa didn’t see like NCAA Tournament teams to me.  I didn’t even realize Tulsa was even being considered.  Based on what I’ve heard, everyone else was surprised too and completely dumbfounded.  Syracuse is also getting slammed for making the NCAA tournament, a 10 seed at that.  Hard to say based on Jim Boeheim’s 9 game suspension, but Syracuse has the potential to surprise people as they always have, but I'm going with Dayton regardless.</p>

<p>On the flip side, there are the teams that just missed the tournament I felt should have made it.  One team in particular, Monmouth, danced their way into many people’s hearts with their infamous bench dance routines, and they were legitimately talented, beating some major programs, including Notre Dame, USC, UCLA and Georgetown, but sadly, they missed the Tournament after losing their conference final to Iona.  Another case of a mid-major team being left out in favor of a mediocre major conference team, i.e. Syracuse, who had a lower RPI than Monmouth.  I like seeing the mid-major teams making the tournament, it's a shame they’re being punished for their conference strength of schedule and losing the conference tournament.  A conversation that happens every year.</p>

<p>Usually, there appears to be one underachieving team ranked lower than expected that’s deep with talent and capable of making a deep run in the tournament.  I don’t see any particularly low seeded teams in the Sweet Sixteen; my lowest pick is 7 seed Iowa.  With that said, Arizona is ranked too low as a 6 seed.  They have the talent to make the Elite 8, and with Iowa or Villanova as a potential Sweet Sixteen matchup, I think they’ll get there.  I don't particularly like Arizona or its cockiness with basketball, but they usually play well come tournament time.</p>

<p>Oregon has quite a tough road to get to the Final Four.  Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M, Duke, Baylor and St. Joseph’s as an 8 seed are tough opponents.  Duke is not the team they were last year, but Mike Krzyzewski is still the best coach in NCAA history.  Oklahoma has possibly the best player in the Tournament with Buddy Hield, an elite scorer and possible top pick in the NBA Draft.  Baylor’s style of play is always tough to handle, though Oregon beat them to begin the season.  Oregon has the talent to make the Final Four, but their depth is a minor issue, as they only play 7 players regularly.  But their top players play really well, defend really well, and are really unselfish, all defining characteristics of their coach Dana Altman.  I could see them losing to Duke or Baylor in the Sweet Sixteen, but being biased, I’m picking them to reach the Final Four because they’ve defied the odds to get to this point.</p>

<p>So, with further ado, here are my Final Four picks: Kansas, Oregon, North Carolina and Michigan State.  Three #1 seeds and a team that probably should’ve been a #1 seed.  I don’t see any real shockers this year.  Kansas has been the most consistent team this year, North Carolina is immensely talented, Oregon is playing really well right now and Michigan State is always prepared to play in the NCAA Tournament.  I don’t think Oregon has the depth to beat Kansas (nor the experience), and Michigan State has the best overall talented player in the country, Denzel Valentine, tough to the bone and ready to play.  In the end, I’m picking the Spartans to win the NCAA Tournament this year.  How will my bracket hold up?</p>

<p>I have never joined a March Madness pool, so it’s never been a competition for me.  But with celebrities and of course, President Obama making their own selections, I tend to compare my to them.  Since this is the last year Obama will be President, I’ll miss ESPN Barack-etology and look forward to hearing his picks in the next day or two, but we’ll see who wins this year.  Will he play it safe or make crazy selections like some of his Republican ‘buddies’ (see Kentucky loving Mitch McConnell or the Anti-Tax Lord Grover Norquist, who always picks the teams whose states have the lowest tax rate, seriously?)?  Will he find a way to show any love for Duke, where his former assistant Reggie Love played on their team?  And will he have an opinion on Oregon State, two years after they fired his brother-in-law Craig Robinson as their head coach?  Here’s hoping for a good battle. [Editor’s note - added March 16, 2016: Obama picked Kansas over North Carolina for his eighth and final Presidential bracket, only in his first year of office did he pick the correct team to win the National Championship].</p>

	<h4>Awwww, what could've been, Monmouth</h4>
</div>

<p>I don’t usually spend much time picking my brackets.  I tend to use my gut instinct and go with it.  Most of the time I put little effort into my picks; for example, Oregon is going to easily beat the Southern Cross winner.  I’ll pick Holy Cross over Southern.  It was easier to pick these play-in games when I did my brackets on paper: I always picked the team with the shorter name.  Doesn’t matter now.  Other times, I wonder just a little; for example, Arkansas Little Rock, with a 29-4 record could very well beat Purdue, but my heart tells me not to pick against the Boilermakers.  In fact, I believe they’ll deny Virginia a third shot at the Spartans in as many years.  I try to be as unbiased as possible, although it’s difficult when Oregon is in as a #1 Seed.  They’re in a tough region and could very well get knocked out in the Sweet Sixteen, but I have to show the Ducks some love, don’t I?  I just don't think they can beat Kansas.</p>

<p>So which NCAA underdog will win America’s heart this year?  Will any of the last teams in prove America wrong and make a deep run?  Which player will shine?  Which games will be instant classics, defined by great plays, buzzer beaters, defensive stops, big slams, etc.?  Who will win the championship?  All that I know is; it’s going to be a wonderful ride.  Welcome to March Madness.</p></div>
