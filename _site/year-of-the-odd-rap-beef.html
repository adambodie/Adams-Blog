<p>We're barely into the month of February and already we've seen not one, but two rather bizarre hip-hop beefs, the type you could never imagine ever existing. On the one hand, we have B.o.B. vs. famed Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and now we have Ghostface Killah vs. infamous pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli (which has now involved the head of the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform). A rather odd consortium of characters, feuding over the most bizarre things. Whose beef is more odd? Here are my thoughts.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="img/bob.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="B.o.B wants to know where the curve is?  Neil deGrasse Tyson knows it's there." class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>B.o.B wants to know where the curve is?  Neil deGrasse Tyson knows it's there.</h4>
</div>

<p>B.o.B vs. Neil deGrasse Tyson: A beef which started a couple of weeks ago, as B.o.B. released a song called 'Flatline,' where B.o.B. dropped some old school knowledge, 16th Century old school knowledge, by claiming the Earth is flat.  Despite indisputable proof that the Earth is round, proven over 500 years ago, B.o.B., trying to provide some reasoning to his thoughts, took to Twitter wondering why distant pictures showed no curve.  Upon hearing about this, super smart Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson called B.o.B. out for not only claiming a debunked theory about the Earth as true, but called him dangerous for even suggesting it, explaining how we know the Earth is round.  Though Tyson isn't a rapper (thankfully), his nephew took the opportunity to come up with a diss record to respond to B.o.B.'s 15th Century claim that the Earth is flat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have Ghostface Killah and his beef with Martin Shkreli.  Who is Martin Shkreli and why is he involved in a beef with the Wu-Tang rapper?  Last year, the Wu-Tang Clan made a secret album called 'Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,' to be sold to one lucky multi-millionaire, with the condition he/she could not profit off the album in any way, shape or form for 88 years.  Sounds stupid, we'll probably hear it within 2 years, but that's another story.  But Martin Shkreli, then the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, bought the album for over 2 million dollars (allegedly).  By the time Shkreli became publically known as the guy who bought the album, he became infamously known for raising the price of a life-saving AIDS drug over 5000%, drawing scorn from just about everyone with a soul.  RZA, the mastermind behind the project, was displeased and criticized him, proclaiming the profits were given to charity after news of Shkreli's actions, and subsequent arrests for fraud, were made public. </p>

<p>But a couple of weeks ago, while B.o.B. was claiming the Earth was flat, Ghostface Killah called Shkreli a shithead, which set off a Twitter battle and Shkreli making a rap video proclaiming he owns Ghostface Killah and is his apparent father (apparently, Shkreli would love to be a rapper).  This led to a bunch of whining from Shkreli, who also demanded an apology for being called a shithead.  But just when you thought this couldn't get any crazier, Martin Shkreli was called to testify to the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform about his extreme price hike of the life-saving Daraprim from $13.50 a pill to $750 a pill.  Not surprisingly, he plead the fifth the entire time, refusing the answer any questions while smirking and calling the Congressmen as 'imbeciles.'  While this action isn't surprising, he was awkwardly asked by chairman Trey Gowdy about his purchase of the Wu-Tang secret album.  Shkreli plead the fifth on that too.  Nothing incriminating about that, but nonetheless, stupid.</p>

	<h4>Rapper vs. Greedy Asshole vs. Incompetent Congressman</h4>
</div>

<p>When it comes to doubting science, most denial of science comes from religion.  Those who believe in creationism, for example, are religious wackos who believe God created everything, including life.  The odd thing about this beef is that B.o.B. actually tries to sound intelligent with his beliefs into a flat Earth.  I admit, I had similar thoughts about the Earth as he did...when I was ten.  Sure, when I walk outside, I don't see any curves.  When seeing things far apart from a distance, I don't see any curves. I don't need to go into the specifics as to how the Earth is clearly round, Neil deGrasse Tyson is much smarter than me (and most people in fact) and he provided a clear, concise and very articulate response.  It got a little corny when Tyson's nephew rapped, but that's expected from someone looking for any sort of fame.  Still it's sad that someone questioned something clearly proven centuries ago.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ghostface Killah's beef with Martin Shkreli sounds more typical of a beef.  Rappers feuding with businessmen, TV personalities and so and so is nothing new.  Dr. Dre slapped TV host Dee Barnes, Ludacris feuded with Bill O'Reilly over his Pepsi endorsement, Mac Miller caught Donald Trump's wrath for not paying him for naming a song after him, and Eminem's many beefs with just about everyone in the media you could imagine.  And with the unfortunate invention of Twitter, rappers and other celebrities can argue virtually over 140 character tweets, sending off rapid fire tweets with minimal effort.  It's sadly a more frequent occurrence.  But Martin Shkreli's purchase of the Wu-Tang album, which he admitted to having, even suggesting he'd destroy the album, gave a backdrop to an odd interaction with Congressman Trey Gowdy, a man who doesn't know who the Wu-Tang Clan is.  Yet here he is asking about the purchase of this album, nothing to do with the price hike, nothing to do with anything other than to get any response from Shkreli, and he still wouldn't say anything other than 'I plead the fifth.'  No wonder Trey Gowdy got nowhere with Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>While seeing a worthless Congressman awkwardly ask a greedy asshole about a secret rap album is quite bizarre, the more bizarre beef goes to B.o.B. and his Flat Earth theory.  Neil deGrasse Tyson wasn't directly challenged, a fan brought it to his attention.  And it led to Tyson's nephew making a corny Drake diss track but dorky and corny.  But we would expect that when the rap gods suddenly find themselves back in time.  Arguing something proven false over 500 years ago while trying to sound intelligent in the process is a lame excuse for trying to prove yourself as a great lyricist.  Ironic for someone who released a song called 'Airplanes,' which wouldn't be able to fly around the world if the Earth was flat.</p>
