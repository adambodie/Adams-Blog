<p>Growing up, I didn't think much of the Los Angeles Clippers. Why should I have? They were a complete joke, a bumbling group of losers who couldn't win squat, couldn't put together a decent roster and worst of all had an incompetent owner who wouldn't spend any money to keep what little talent they had. It wasn't until the other owners handed them Chris Paul in an effort to keep him from being traded to the Laker did the Clippers finally start to look like a real basketball team. But as the Lakers sunk to the floor, have the Clippers overtaken them? Not even close. No matter how talented the Clippers are, they’ll always be in second place, and incapable of winning the title. Whether they like it or not, they are defined by their disgraceful former owner Donald Sterling.</p>

	<h4>Everything Clippers related is tied to Donald Sterling, the joke.</h4>
</div>



<p>The Clippers had an obvious crisis two years ago when Donald Sterling was recorded making numerous racist remarks about his fans, bringing the Clippers to national headlines, as people were disgusted with their idiotic owner and the players angry over the comments as well.  Even after kicking Sterling to the curb and being bought by Microsoft billionaire Steven Ballmer with his own money, the Clippers are still losers compared to the Lakers, even if they’re winning more than the Lakers.  They haven't completely shaken the bad aura of Donald Sterling, affecting their attitude and play in the process, often finding themselves on the wrong end of disappointment.</p>

<p>The Clippers have never made it to the Western Conference finals, let alone the NBA finals in their history, from their foundings as the Buffalo Braves to their unnoticeable years as the San Diego Clippers and of course, as the ‘Donald Sterling joined L.A. because he couldn’t beat the Lakers, so he joined them‘ Los Angeles Clippers. They had a chance last year but blew a 3-1 lead against Houston.  Typical Clippers blunders, one joke after another, and had home court advantage to boot after 4 games.  This despite having a talented roster led by Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, who rank as two of the most talented players in the NBA.  And this year, with a possible chance to play Golden State without Steph Curry, they manage to lose both Blake Griffin and Chris Paul for the season in the same game. Beating Portland just became a lot tougher, if they can even do that at all.  But one has to wonder how the Clippers keep messing things up?</p>

<p>They have a great coach in Doc Rivers; the only coach with NBA title winning pedigree, maturity and understanding of the Donald Sterling mess, really the only coach capable of bringing the team together and sympathizing with their plight as well.  Chris Paul is an elite point guard, great leader and the heart and soul of the team.  You’d think those two would bring the character the Clippers need.  Instead, they have obnoxious, selfish players who gloat like Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.  Blake Griffin, the guy who broke his hand punching an assistant trainer in a stupid fight, costing him a month of action. DeAndre Jordan, who waffled between leaving for Dallas and staying with the Clippers, loving every minute of the attention he got via the so-called Emoji Wars.  Unfortunately, it's these two who carry the team's me-first Lob City gloating attitude that makes the Clippers the underachieving team they are.</p>

<p>The Lakers never acted like that during any of their prime years.  Yet the Clippers seem to casually stroll into games like it doesn't care, lacking the instinct to perform to its potential.  They wouldn't even be a playoff team without Chris Paul; he’s the only player with heart, which goes without saying.  Is it because of Donald Sterling’s past influence? The feeling they’ll never pass the Lakers in prestige?  Maybe their key players are immature cry baby's with questionable character flaws.  Whatever the case, it's apparent that while Steve Ballmer can throw a whole bunch of money to try to make the Clippers a serious team, they'll never get rid of the curse that is Donald Sterling. So while Laker fans are saddened by their team's recent struggles, it compares nothing to being the sad joke that is the Los Angeles Clippers.</p>
