<p>One week into the season, the Lakers are winless (0-4) and have not looked impressive as a whole.  Am I that surprised?  Of course not.  Does the Lakers future look bright?  I'd say yeah, not this year, but a couple years down the road, the Lakers will be contending again.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>Kobe Bryant upset after a call.</h4>
</div>


<p>Let's start with Kobe Bryant.  His career is almost over, he can't shoot like he used it, and he knows it's a problem.  So unfortunate he's gotten to this point, for all the years of heart and sacrifice he put with the Lakers, and now he's a shell of himself.  But Kobe has an opportunity to develop some young talented players if he can control his shooting tendencies.  Jordan Clarkson looks like a keeper, he's a good shooter and has the heart.  Plus with D'Angelo Russell being drafted, I get the feeling Clarkson has a chip on his shoulder, as he should.  A second-round pick last year who knows by name and order of every point guard taken before him should have plenty of motivation.  As someone who loves that kind of fire, I believe the future is bright for Clarkson.  It's the main reason I wouldn't have taken Russell at the 2nd pick, but we'll see how D'Angelo Russell turns out.</p>
<p>Speaking of D'Angelo Russell, he's young and raw, so I'll remain patient for a couple of years and hope he turns out well.  He made some nice passes in last night's game against Denver.  But is he going to be the next LeBron?  Of course not.  Kobe wasn't very good his first year, and he was straight outta high school.  Jordan Clarkson spent three years in college, he's battle tested.</p>
<p>As for the other bright young star for the Lakers, Julius Randle, watch out NBA, Randle has some freakish skills.  In a couple years, when he learns everything, he's going to dominate.  With the bruising style of Zach Randolph mixed with Lamar Odom's finesse, Julius Randle is not your ordinary player.  Watching him take the ball down the court is a sight to see.  He's still young, but perhaps the broken leg in his rookie year will help his game in the long run.  Defensively he needs help but other than that, wow.</p>
<p>Another week went by, and the Lakers finally got their first victory of the season, against the Brooklyn Nets (who of course are also winless).</p>
