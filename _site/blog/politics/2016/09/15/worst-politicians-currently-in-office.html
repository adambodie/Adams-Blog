<p> Let's be honest, politics is dumb at its core and politicians are terrible.  Currently, Congress has an approval rating of about 10% or so.  Plenty of our current politicians couldn't figure their way out of a paper bag, much less pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation.  No matter who's elected President, Congress will always find ways to screw things up and stop real progress from happening.  With that said, here are the 15 worst members of Congress, and as an added bonus, the 5 worst Governors.</p>
<div class="row">
    <h1>Worst Congressmen (and Congresswomen)</h1>

		<img src="/img/joe-wilson.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Joe Wilson" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Joe Wilson</h4>
    </div>
    <h3>15. Joe Wilson - South Carolina House of Representative - 2nd District</h3>
    <p>A rude and racist congressman who once yelled at Obama "You lie!" while Obama gave a speech on health care, Joe Wilson proved what a bozo he really is. Of course, Joe Wilson's racist approach to Obama was filled with hate and lies, as contrary to what Joe Wilson claimed, Obamacare does not provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants.  Democrats rebuked him, but Republicans protected him for something they'd complain about if a Democrat did the same thing to a Republican President.  Hypocrisy strikes again.</p>

<div class="row">

		<img src="/img/mike-lee.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mike Lee" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mike Lee</h4>
    </div>
    <h3>14. Mike Lee - Utah Senator</h3>
    <p>All you need to know about Mike Lee is that he's Ted Cruz's sidekick.  Plus he single handedly stopped a bill giving financial relief to Flint, Michigan by claiming "They have plenty of money."  If there's anyone willing to follow Ted Cruz, it's Mike Lee.  Despite lacking major recognition, that alone gets Mike Lee on the list.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/mark-sanford.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mark Sanford" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mark Sanford</h4>
    </div>
    <h3>13. Mark Sanford - South Carolina House of Representative - 1st District</h3>
    <p>As former Governor, Sanford lied to his people by claiming he wanted to take a hike on the Appalachians, only to go legally missing for six days in 2009 before turning up in Argentina with his mistress.  Yet years later, after his time as Governor ended, South Carolinians in the first district forgave him by electing him back into political office.  Surely, they wouldn't feel the same way about Bill Clinton's affair…</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/lindsey-graham.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lindsey Graham" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Lindsey Graham</h4>
</div>
<h3>12. Lindsey Graham - South Carolina Senator</h3>
<p>A man John McCain once called his illegitimate son due to their military based similarities, Lindsey Graham is far less likeable and hasn't accomplished nearly as much as John McCain. If it were up to people like Graham and McCain, we'd spend all eternity in the Middle East fighting their wars, we don't have a clue of how to make things stable without our intervention.  It's no wonder Lindsey Graham couldn't even get 1% Republican support in the Presidential race.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/marco-rubio.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Marco Rubio" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Marco Rubio</h4>
</div>
<h3>11. Marco Rubio - Florida Senator</h3>
<p>His values are decent but Marco Rubio is as untrustworthy and unreliable as they come.  He barely showed up to work as Senator, didn't want to run for re-election, but was pushed back in by external forces wanting to keep his seat and the Senate Majority Red.  His Presidential candidacy was predictable and uninspiring, going as far to insult Donald Trump's hand size.  Not the right message from someone who actually has Presidential material, but blew it acting like a child and ultimately lost his home state badly.</p>

<div class="row">

		<img src="/img/steve-scalise.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Steve Scalise" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Steve Scalise</h4>
</div>
<h3>10. Steve Scalise - Louisiana House of Representative - 1st District</h3>
<p>Steve Scalise, one of the highest ranking members in Congress, once spoke to a white supremacist group looking for support, claiming he didn't know he was speaking to a white supremacist group founded by the infamous David Duke.  He should've known better than associating himself with David Duke.</p>

		<img src="/img/jim-jordan.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jim Jordan" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Jim Jordan</h4>
</div>
<h3>9. Jim Jordan - Ohio House of Representative - 4th District</h3>
<p>One of two ultra conservative voices on the Benghazi committee, who didn't think their wasteful investigation into Hillary Clinton for the third time did enough to blame her, so he and fellow extremist Freedom Caucus member Mike Pompeo added to the Republican report nonsense blaming Hillary for something she didn't do.  Jim Jordan makes this list as the Chairman of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/rand-paul.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Rand Paul" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Rand Paul</h4>
</div>
<h3>8. Rand Paul - Kentucky Senator</h3>
<p>Good old Aqua Buddha, the pretend Libertarian, who fights for privacy rights yet thinks the Government can force a woman to remain pregnant, Rand Paul is a fake Libertarian wannabe who once called Obama gay for supporting gay marriage (obviously a homophobic slur meaning 'stupid,' not a belief Obama is actually gay).  Rand Paul had such little confidence of winning the Presidential election that he forced Kentucky to change its rules to allow him to run for Senate as a backup plan.  He obviously didn't make it past Iowa, as not surprisingly, Rand Paul couldn't convince his Dad's followers to support him like they did Ron Paul since he's a phony.</p>

		<img src="/img/joni-ernst.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Joni Ernst" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Joni Ernst</h4>
</div>
<h3>7. Joni Ernst - Iowa Senator</h3>
<p>Joni Ernst, just elected Senator, scares the crap out of me.  Her looks, her actions and goofy smile makes her creepy.  Anyone who thinks Obama is a dictator but ignores Donald Trump's love for dictators and desire to be a dictator doesn't know what the word dictator means.  As someone who claims her experience castrating pigs would make her perfect for cutting "pork" (wasteful spending), I have no clue why the fair-minded people in Iowa voted for her.</p>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/trey-gowdy.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Trey Gowdy" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Trey Gowdy</h4>
</div>
<h3>6. Trey Gowdy - South Carolina House of Representative - 4th District</h3>
<p>The current head of the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi, also known as the Hillary Clinton Witch Hunt, Trey Gowdy, who looks like a ghost, accomplished nothing with the Republican witch hunt, wasting millions of dollars to find absolutely nothing new, creating a report all by themselves so the Democrats couldn't say anything nice.  Even worse, he awkwardly questioned Martin Shkreli for his purchase of the secret Wu-Tang Clan album which led to a bizarre back-and-forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/jim-inhofe.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Jim Inhofe" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Jim Inhofe</h4>
</div>
<h3>5. Jim Inhofe - Oklahoma Senator</h3>
<p>A man whose brain must be made of snowballs, as Jim Inhofe, who infamously brought a snowball to a congressional meeting on climate change to make the claim that the existence of snow disproves climate change altogether.  Only an idiot like him would come to that conclusion, clearly there are 4 seasons throughout the year due to the Earth's axis tilt, and it's going to be summer somewhere on planet Earth.  Even worse, Inhofe claims religion as the sole reason it's a hoax.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/steve-king.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Steve King" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Steve King</h4>
</div>
<h3>4. Steve King - Iowa House of Representative - 4th District</h3>
<p>Steve King, King of the Anti-Hispanics claiming to be the King of Anti-Illegal Immigration, is a hateful scumbag who recently claimed that only white people have contributed to Western Society.  For someone like Steve King, immigrants aren't livestock but human beings, and treating them like animals is inhumane.  Steve King is the worst member of the House of Representatives, frequently making racist and homophobic remarks, as well as inflammatory remarks about President Obama, claiming he's a Muslim savior.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/tom-cotton.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tom Cotton" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Tom Cotton</h4>
</div>
<h3>3. Tom Cotton - Arkansas Senator</h3>
<p>Barely in his first term as Senator, Tom Cotton, the youngest member in the Senate, led the way to trying to interfere with the Iran deal by sending a letter to the Supreme Leader of Iran with 46 other Republican senators telling Iran any deal made with Obama can be taken away and that he had no authority to make such a deal.  This type of action is illegal and should be criminal to interfere with a deal they aren't negotiating.</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/mitch-mcconnell.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mitch McConnell" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mitch McConnell</h4>
</div>
<h3>2. Mitch McConnell - Kentucky Senator</h3>
<p>The Senate Majority leader who promised Republicans would accomplish more with control yet has accomplished nothing but play games and rewrite the rules.  For a man who once made it his mission to make Obama a one-term President, Mitch McConnell refuses to hold a vote on a replacement for Justice Scalia, inventing rules of 'the American people need to vote for a new justice' (not their choice) while blaming Obama for his actions (not accepting Justice Alito in 2006 is not the same as not holding a vote on Justice Alito in 2006).  A terrible Senate Leader, the Democrats need to take majority back.  Even worse, he takes credit for something he had no involvement in (a rising economy which Republicans have consistently fought against).</p>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/ted-cruz.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Ted Cruz" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Ted Cruz</h4>
</div>
<h3>1. Ted Cruz - Texas Senator</h3>
<p>Without a doubt the worst Senator of modern times, rivaling the infamous Joseph McCarthy as the worst of all time, a selfish degenerate who only thinks of himself and would have no problem destroying the very fabric of this nation just to get his way, as shown with his Government shutdown.  It's very clear that Ted Cruz lives to oppose everything Obama has done, he even voted against a bill once Obama supported it.  This man is the most hateful person ever, believing everything should be about Christianity, trampling over everyone who's not Christian.  Ted Cruz is well disliked by both parties and after his speech at the RNC, will have the biggest target on his back in 2018 when he's up for reelection.  This man is a cancer and needs to go now!</p>

		<img src="/img/chris-christie.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Chris Christie" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Chris Christie</h4>
</div>
<h3>5. Chris Christie - New Jersey</h3>
<p>Chris Christie, the biggest opportunistic blowhard of them all, first doing the right thing by working with Obama for assistance with Hurricane Sandy, then complaining about Democrats after receiving negative comments from fellow Republicans, all to further his Presidential ambitions.  Chris Christie only cares about himself and will do anything, bashing Donald Trump during his own campaign but became Trump's biggest ass-kisser after he dropped out, desperate to be Vice President (which he didn't get). His mock trial of Hillary at the RNC was stupid and childish.  It's no wonder the people of New Jersey were so angry that they asked him to resign after endorsing Trump, in addition to their floundering economy.  And with the Bridgegate scandal hurting him despite his claims he knew nothing about it, chances are that's probably a lie based on his bullying ways.  Guilty of Not Guilty of being involved in Bridgegate?  Guilty!</p>

		<img src="/img/rick-snyder.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Rick Snyder" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Rick Snyder</h4>
</div>
<h3>4. Rick Snyder - Michigan</h3>
<p>Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, has led the city of Flint into a complete hell-hole thanks to his decision to change their water source for cost-cutting measures, all while refusing to spend a few extra bucks to treat lead-tainted water.  If that isn't bad enough, two years later, he has refused to do anything about it, ignoring the problem until the media started complaining.  He has refused to accept any responsibility for any of this, blaming Democrats for targeting him.  He even challenged himself to drink their lead-tainted water for 30 days straight, but never followed through, instead traveling overseas in an obvious attempt to appear reasonable.  </p>

		<img src="/img/mike-pence.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mike Pence" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mike Pence</h4>
</div>
<h3>3. Mike Pence - Indiana</h3>
<p>The Governor of Indiana, an abortion hating religious freedom law passing homophobe, is the only person stupid enough to accept an offer to be Donald Trump's running mate.  He even made this following quote about Donald Trump: "Not since Ronald Reagan in my lifetime has there been a man or woman at the national level who has heard the frustrations and the aspirations of the American people the way (Trump) does."   Despite this, he gave the worst endorsement in the history of endorsements to Ted Cruz, which helped lead to Ted Cruz's demise in his home state of Indiana, instead spending more time praising Donald Trump.  His handling of Indiana's religious freedom bill, which got scrapped, is a prime example of how stupid he truly is, unaware of what the word 'discrimination' means.</p>

		<h4>Sam Brownback</h4>
</div>
<h3>2. Sam Brownback - Kansas</h3>
<p>Sam Brownback presided over some of the most extreme tax cuts in history, costing Kansas millions of jobs and destroying their economy, in the name of Tea Party based experiments that have clearly failed.  Despite Kansas Republicans favoring a moderate Democrat to defeat him in the last election, the voters of Kansas re-elected this economy wrecking bozo.  Turns out the great experiment has been a complete catastrophe to everyone except for Brownback himself.  He also removed gay rights in the public sector, claiming it would help military veterans somehow.</p>

		<img src="/img/pat-mccrory.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Pat McCrory" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Pat McCrory</h4>
</div>
<h3>1. Pat McCrory - North Carolina</h3>
<p>Pat McCrory is a lunatic who thinks bathroom use is the most important thing needing to be fixed in North Carolina, as he has waged war against all the LGBT, believing no city in his state can give them the human rights they deserve while claiming transgenders don't exist, don't have any rights, and are likely to be sexual predators targeting women in bathrooms. If that's not bad enough, he blames it on Charlotte for giving the LGBT the rights they deserve.  He doesn't care how much money he's costing the state, especially after the NBA yanked the All-Star game from Charlotte, instead continuing his war in the bathroom.  Instead, he's willing to sue the Government for protecting basic human rights.  It's not common sense, it's discriminatory.  Pat McCrory, who clearly is using this war to get Republican support during an Election year, needs to be voted out.  The state of North Carolina deserves better.</p>
