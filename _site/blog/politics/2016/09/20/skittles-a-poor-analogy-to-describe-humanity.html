<p> Today, Donald Trump Jr., son of the racist bigot Idiot whom he's named after, again proved that racism is learned, much like his racist father and grandfather, by making this ridiculous analogy about Syrian refugees: "If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you.  Would you take a handful?"  Aside from being moronic and overly simplistic, statements like this are a perfect example of why racial profiling is flat out wrong.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Skittles, just candy</h4>
</div>
<p>As Mars, Incorporated, the makers of Skittles pointed out, "Skittles are candy; refugees are people."  Anyone who wants to treat human beings as candy is purely stupid and ignorant.  Skittles are all made the same way, have the same ingredients, the only difference is their color and taste.  But even amongst those flavors, each flavor is made the same and are supposed to be the same.  Two yellow Skittles are the same.  Two red Skittles are the same as well.  Human beings on the other hand, are complex individuals with unique DNA, personality and other characteristics that makes them one unique human being (twins aside, but that's an exception to the rule, not a commonality).  A human being with brown hair, white skin and green eyes is always going to be different from another human being with brown hair, white skin and green eyes due to the complexity of human beings.</p>
<p>Treating people like candy is the perfect metaphor for racial profiling.  By definition, racial profiling is judging people based on characteristics.  Most times, it's a person's negative characteristics that's used for racial profiling.  It doesn't matter how good a person is, to some, it's better to assume they might be bad to catch the bad ones than it is to treat them all as good and let a bad one get through.  This might work with candy; if a bad batch is made, you can simply throw it out and make a new batch, but this doesn't work with human beings.  You can't simply recycle or throw away human beings like you would with candy.</p>
<p>The actions of a few cannot be used to judge an entire group of people.  It's not true about candy nor is it excuse to discriminate against other human beings.  Yet some claim it's the only way to stop terrorism.  A better way is to do what we currently do, judge each person individually, not judge them based on perceived characteristics which may or may not be true about said individual. That way, a person can be judge by all of their characteristics, not just their appearance.  Unfortunately, some people will often harbor negative feelings towards someone solely based on the color of their skin.  In the case of Syrian refugees, it's based solely on their Islamic faith, which some people make their decision primarily based on skin color.</p>
<p>There's always the chance someone falls through the cracks; there's nothing we can do to stop that.  But that doesn't mean we can't deny rights to the many that are good hard-working human beings.  After all, the defining characteristic of a person with the intent to commit a crime is not their skin color, nationality nor religion, it's their intent to commit a crime.  Racial profiling does nothing but lead people to only be on the lookout for a certain group of people.  Any person is capable of committing a crime.  But while racists will judge a terrorist like Ahmad Rahami of being representative of all Muslims, these same people will not make the same comparison for terrorists like Dylann Roof to all white people.  To them, a good Muslim is worse than a bad Christian.  But that is simply not true.  The people these racists will assume as Muslims may not be even Muslim as all, the gentleman who spotted Ahmad Rahami shares a similar skin complexion, but is a Sikh, whom share no connection with Muslims whatsoever.  Racial profiling is not only wrong but ineffective, since skin color doesn't define a person's religion.</p>
<p>The next time you want to eat some Skittles, just remember they're just candy.  Mars Incorporated does the best it can to ensure the quality of their product.  It's entirely possible a stale Skittle makes it in the pile, but it isn't likely to happen.  That doesn't mean you should never eat Skittles again or throw out every bag of Skittles in your cabinet because one might make you sick in your stomach.  This wouldn't be acceptable with candy, and this is not the way Syrian refugees should be treated to, as they are human beings with far more complexities than your average piece of candy.  So while Donald Trump Jr. should probably stay away from Skittles as he will likely be paranoid that someone will give him poisoned candy over his stupid and ignorant comments, the rest of us can enjoy candy and know it's just that, candy.</p>
