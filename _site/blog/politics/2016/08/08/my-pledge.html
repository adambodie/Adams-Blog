<div class="article">
<p> Three months from today, on November 8th, the country I call home, the United States of America, will elect a new President. Our country's future is at stake.  On one hand is Hillary Clinton, Former First Lady, Senator of New York and Secretary of State.  On the other hand is Donald Trump, who can simply be described as a Tyrannical Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig.  I am sick and tired of hearing about this fool.  Everything he says is stupid, childish and filled with hate.  There are a plethora of reasons not to vote for this degenerate, I've managed to find one-hundred reasons, but the reasons don't stop there.  He has zero qualities of a worthy President and even less qualities of a proud American. This is why I am taking a pledge to no longer refer to him by his name and pledge to start calling him simply as The Idiot.</p>

<h4>Claiming to like Hispanics by eating 'their' food is a stupid attempt at getting their support.</h4>	
</div>

<h3>On Immigration</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on immigration.  When the Idiot first entered the race, he managed to set the tone for his whole campaign by saying <span>"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."</span>  This obviously appeals to racist bigots who hate all things Hispanic, but most immigrants are good people and only leads to discrimination against Hispanics in general, no matter their legal status.  He even had the nerve to ask <span>"Well, somebody's doing the raping, Don (Lemon)! I mean somebody's doing it! Who's doing the raping? Who's doing the raping?"</span>  As if every rapist in the United States is somehow undocumented and from Mexico?  Not true!  The Idiot doesn't have any ideas to fix our broken immigration system other than to say <span>"Mexico's going to pay for the wall."</span>  Historically speaking, walls have never been effective and anyone wanting to cross the border will find ways to get over the stupid wall.  It's especially stupid to think that Mexico will pay for something they don't want.  Stronger border security is the best way to go.  Not bashing all undocumented immigrants, singling them out for committing crimes when crimes are committed by all races, genders and religions, or building a stupid wall.  The immigration system isn't perfect, but with over 11 million undocumented immigrants, the solution isn't as easy as treating all of them as criminals and deporting them.</p>


<h3>On Terrorism</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on terrorism.  Keeping us safe is not as easy as saying <span>"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States."</span>  This does nothing to stop attacks like the ones in Boston, Orlando, Fort Hood and San Bernardino, all committed by Muslim-Americans, many of whom were born in America, and like his attacks on immigrants, unfairly places the blame on foreigners, treating them all as potential criminals rather than people.  An actual strategy to stop Terrorism requires working with our allies to attack Terrorists, rather than declaring war on all of Islam, as the Idiot has clearly done multiple times <span>"I think Islam hates us."</span>  That only encourages Terrorists like ISIS to continue their fight and justify their message that somehow "The West hates them," even though that's not true.  They're already using the Idiot's words for propaganda.  This is from someone who didn't think ISIS was even our fight to begin with, <span>"Let Syria and ISIS fight. Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS."</span>  The Idiot's methods for defeating Terrorism include committing war crimes, <span>"The other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families,"</span> creating a national registry for Muslims <span>"I would certainly implement that, absolutely,"</span> singling out refugees as the only ones capable of committing attacks at home with the false idea that <span>"There is 'no system to vet' refugees from the Middle East,"</span> and using three little words, <span>"In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam.' For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency."</span>  Coming from a man who claims <span>"I know more about ISIS than the generals do,"</span> it's not surprising with his idiotic ideas that he knows nothing about fighting terrorists or the Middle East in general.  Of course, when 49 innocent people were killed by an ISIS supporter in Orlando, all this Idiot could do was take credit for being 'right' about terrorism, even though he was dead wrong <span>"Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness and vigilance. We must be smart!"</span></p>

		<h4>This Idiot thought this was true.  It's not even remotely true.</h4>
</div>
<h3>On Race Relations</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on race relations.  Obama is not responsible for making race relations worse, as the Idiot claims <span>"I'm a unifier, unlike our president now, I'm a unifier"</span>.  It's people like The Idiot who refuse to accept the fact that we elected an African American President (twice).  It's ridiculous for the Idiot to claim that blacks are responsible for most gun crimes in the country, all while siding with White Supremacists and not being outraged by their support <span>"I don't know anything about David Duke."</span>   The Idiot targets blacks, Hispanics, and Muslims, yet with White Supremacists, he retweets their racist, anti-Semitic imagery while running a campaign tailored for their policies, no matter what the Idiot says otherwise.  That's why David Duke is so enthusiastic about The Idiot's campaign.  The Idiot frequently injects racist names when discussing African Americans <span>"Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!"</span> or with Hispanics <span>"The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals!"</span>  This divisive attitude has fueled the anger that had led to more shootings and violence throughout the nation.  For someone who claims <span>"I am least racist person there is,"</span> he has done nothing but attacked African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, Asians and just about every other minority with bigoted hate-filled spew.</p>

		<h4>The Idiot's campaign is catered for White Supremacists: That's why he always retweets their ideas rather than dismiss them as hate-speech.</h4>
</div>
<h3>On Guns</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on guns.  No one is trying to get rid of the 2nd Amendment, despite the Idiot claims that <span>"Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment."</span>  Increasing background checks a little is not the mass destruction of gun rights.  It's protected to keep the guns out of the hands from those who don't need them; criminals and terrorists.  These opinions are bought by the NRA, and their corruption and lack of empathy on gun shootings must stop. Having a gun on you doesn't guarantee your survival from an attack, <span>"The bullets were going one way, not the other way. And if they were, if somebody had protection, a few people, not all, a few people had protection we would not have had 130 people dead."</span>  Too bad those who commit these acts are more prepared and have stronger weapons than a simple handgun for protecting.  Handguns won't stop suicide bombers who want to die, powerful assault weapons designed to kill or trucks driven by maniacs.  Requiring teachers to have guns will make those wanting to shoot up a school go after the teacher first, <span>"Let me tell you, if you had a couple teachers with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a lot better off."</span>  We can't live our lives waiting for someone to shoot us, and we shouldn't have to.  It's way too easy for criminals to get a hold of guns, with all the loopholes the NRA wants to leave open.  This Idiot even claims that Hillary Clinton wants to release violent criminals from jail, claiming <span>"This is Hillary Clinton's agenda, too, to release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released."</span>  Too many people have died and nothing is being done about it, yet The Idiot only shows compassion for the victims and their loved ones if the perpetrator is undocumented, Muslim or Black.  All victims of gun violence deserve the same love and attention, regardless of who killed them.</p>

<h3>On The Economy</h3>
<p>The Idiot is wrong on the Economy.  How can someone filthy rich <span>"I'm Really Rich!"</span> understand the plight of the common man?  Giving the rich huge tax breaks won't trickle down the economy.  This Idiot has taken advantage of every rule and loophole to maximize his profit without any regard for anyone but himself, <span>"It's none of your business, you'll see it when I release. But I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible."</span>  It's no wonder he refuses to release his taxes.  Take it from someone who's filed Bankruptcy four times <span>"I have never gone bankrupt, by the way"</span>, all while stifling contractors and taking the money for himself.  This is from someone who hires foreign workers almost exclusively, the same ones he bashes on a regular basis, while thinking it's easy to get jobs back here <span>"We're going to bring businesses back. We're going to have businesses that are now in Mexico come back to New Hampshire and you can tell them to go f*** themselves."</span>  That's not the economy working for all, that's the economy working for him.  We need someone who understands how to get money for the middle class, not someone who thinks wages are too high <span>"But, taxes too high, wages too high, we're not going to be able to compete against the world. I hate to say it, but we have to leave it the way it is. People have to go out, they have to work really hard and have to get into that upper stratosphere."</span>  They're not!  And we certainly need someone who will get us out of debt, not someone who loves debt <span>"I'm the king of debt. I love debt,"</span> or thinks printing more money is a good idea <span>"You never have to default because you print the money."</span></p>

</div>
<h3>On Women</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on Women.  He calls them names, objectifies them solely on their looks <span>"Look at that face! Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?,"</span> proclaims they're playing the 'woman card' to win <span>"The only card she (Hillary Clinton) has to play is the woman's card,"</span> and makes vulgar jokes about menstruation <span>"You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes. Blood coming out of her wherever,"</span> and rape <span>"...she got schlonged, she lost, I mean she lost."</span> The Idiot thinks women should be punished for abortions, <span>"There has to be some form of punishment."</span>  When it comes to equal pay, the Idiot claims woman need to work harder to get the same salary as a man when they already do, <span>"You're gonna make the same if you do as good a job."</span>  The Idiot even selected extreme Anti-Abortionist Mike Pence as his running mate.  Shouldn't expect anything less from a womanizing unfaithful husband who would date his own daughter if he could, <span>"If Ivanka weren't my daughter, perhaps I'd be dating her"</span> and raped his first wife.  Women are people too, not objects.</p>

<h3>On Healthcare</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on healthcare.  He has no actual ideas to fix Obamacare, other than to claim that he will <span>"Replace with something terrific."</span>  That's code for nothing.  Republican's have had years to try to improve Obamacare but have done nothing but want to get rid of it and go back to the way things were.  Get some ideas or don't say anything at all. By the way, the website works, <span>"The $5 billion website for Obamacare - never worked. Still doesn't work."</span> It really works.  And vaccines don't cause Autism <span>"We had so many instances [in which] a child had a vaccine, and came back and a week back had a tremendous fever, got very very sick, and now is autistic."</span> Anyone who believes that is an idiot, as this has been disproven for years now.</p>

<h4>The Idiot claims proof Obama supports ISIS, but this is obviously not true.</h4>
</div>

<h3>On President Obama</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on Obama.  President Obama was born in Hawaii, not Kenya <span>"His grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth, okay?"</span> and he's a Christian, not Muslim <span>"I wonder if President Obama would have attended the funeral of Justice Scalia if it were held in a Mosque? Very sad that he did not go!"</span>  This was proven years ago, yet the Idiot still thinks he's a Kenyan-born Muslim and refuses to correct anyone with the truth, even blaming Hillary for the the Birther movement which he is the king of <span>"Just remember, the birther movement was started by Hillary Clinton in 2008. She was all in!"</span>  The Idiot claims Obama supports terrorism <span>"President Obama claims to know our enemy, and yet he continues to prioritize our enemy over our allies, and for that matter, the American people,"</span> and has divided America based on color <span>"The irresponsible rhetoric of our President, who has used the pulpit of the presidency to divide us by race and color, has made America a more dangerous environment for everyone."</span>   The Idiot claims Obama is the worst President ever <span>"'In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue.' This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history!"</span> None of this is true.  Obama gave the order to kill Osama bin Laden, speaks greatly about people of all races and color and got us out of the Recession.  The Idiot, like every extreme Republican, refuses to believe One Word the President has ever said and will say anything against him (Not one Republican criticized George W. Bush for not stating those three little words but yet it's only an issue with Obama as President).  End of Story.</p>

<h3>On Climate Change</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on Climate Change.  No, Global Warming is not a hoax invented by the Chinese <span>"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive."</span>  97% of all Scientists agree it's real.  And just because it's snowing one place <span>"Snowing in Texas and Louisiana, record setting freezing temperatures throughout the country and beyond. Global warming is an expensive hoax!"</span> doesn't mean it's snowing on the opposite side of the world.  That's why we have four seasons.  By the way, we haven't heard anything from the Idiot regarding Flint's water problems.  Who really cares about the environment? Not the Idiot wanting support from the very organizations polluting the Earth for profit.  It is a bigger potential concern than Terrorism, it affect everybody, including Terrorists.</p>

		<h4>This Idiot expects us to "Believe Me" with numbers.  Ridiculous!</h4>
</div>

<h3>On Numbers</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on Numbers. Pick a number, any number.  If used by Donald Trump, there's a 1000% chance it's not the right number and a complete over exaggeration of the truth.  <span>"Don't believe those phony numbers when you hear 4.9 and 5 percent unemployment. The number's probably 28, 29, as high as 35. In fact, I even heard recently 42 percent."</span> The unemployment rate may not show a complete picture, but it's far closer to 5% than 42%.  <span>"I am now hearing it's 30 million, it could be 34 million, which is a much bigger problem."</span>  Try 11 million undocumented immigrants. <span>"We're the highest taxed nation in the world."</span> Not even close. <span>"If you look at what's going on in this country, African-American youth is an example: 59 percent unemployment rate; 59 percent."</span> Try 19 percent. <span>"We have 93 million people out of work. They look for jobs, they give up, and all of a sudden, statistically, they're considered employed."</span> Closer to 21 million, and no, they're not considered employed. Not even close. <span>"He's gonna tax you people at 90 percent."</span> Bernie Sanders wouldn't do that.  When the Idiot mentions a number, do yourself a favor, don't believe it, you can't believe a word he says.</p>

<h3>On Leadership Qualties</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on Leadership qualities.  Being a great leader is willing to work others.  The Idiot on the other hand thinks dictators like Vladimir Putin <span>"I will tell you in terms of leadership he is getting an 'A,' and our president is not doing so well,"</span> and Kim Jong Un <span>"It's incredible. He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one. I mean this guy doesn't play games. And we can't play games with him,"</span> are great leaders.  He calls Obama weak and criticizes his allies <span>"He's (Vladimir Putin) making mincemeat out of our president,"</span>  while praising Saddam Hussein for killing terrorists <span>"He was a bad guy -- really bad guy. But you know what? He did well? He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights. They didn't talk. They were terrorists. Over."</span>.  Too bad Saddam Hussein was a well-known sponsor of terrorism and protected groups that aligned with him.  These are not great leadership qualities.  Leaders have empathy for others, while the Idiot hasn't shown empathy for anyone but himself.  That type of leadership is more for dictators.  A foreshadowing of what life would be if this Idiot was elected President.</p>

<h3>On Character</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on Character.  This Idiot has no redeeming characteristics.  Instead, this Idiot acts like a five year old when arguing with others <span>"He started it. I didn't start it."</span>, makes up stupid childish nicknames <span>"Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted!"</span> makes childish threats out of spite <span>"The wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me,"</span> makes jokes about his genitalia <span>"And, he (Marco Rubio) referred to my hands if they're small, something else is small,"</span> claims to have seen videos that don't exist <span>"And I watched in Jersey City, N.J., where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering,"</span> repeats ridiculously false conspiracy theories <span>"His (Ted Cruz's) father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald being, you know, shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous. What is this, right, prior to his being shot? And nobody even brings it up,"</span> mocks POW's <span>"He's (John McCain) not a war hero -- he's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured."</span>, stereotypes people based solely on their name <span>"Take a look. I mean, you look at the names, you look at what's happened. You tell me,"</span> makes fun of someone's disability <span>"Now, the poor guy, you've got to see this guy: 'Uhh, I don't know what I said. Uhh, I don't remember,' he's going like 'I don't remember. Maybe that's what I said'"</span> promotes violence at his rallies <span>"Knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. OK? Just knock the hell -- I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,"</span>, threatens violence at other people's rallies <span>"Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!"</span>, claims he wouldn't lose supporters if he shot someone <span>"I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose voters,"</span> claims an American born judge is out to get him solely on his ethnicity <span>"I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater, we believe, Mexican, which is great."</span>, verbally attacks a Muslim woman in grief of losing her son in the Iraq War for not speaking <span>"If you look at his wife, she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn't allowed to have anything to say. You tell me,"</span> diminishes the value of a life lost in war <span>"I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures,"</span> all while claiming to be the victim every time someone says something negative about him <span>"I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!"</span> This Idiot has no redeeming qualities on character and can't take the slightest criticism without scorching the Earth every time someone goes after him.  The First Amendment is for all Americans, not just for The Idiot and his followers.  No person would ever act this way to others, let alone a President to his country.  This Idiot will believe anything that's on the Internet <span>"I don't know, all I know is what's on the internet,"</span>, even if it's clearly not true...<span>"USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail!  <a href="https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD">https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD</a>?ssr=true"</span> unless it's about him.</p>

		<h4>This Idiot hates America, he'd be glad to take everything from us just to enrich himself.</h4>

<h3>On America</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on America.  We're not on fire, crime isn't rising, refugees aren't coming in to attack us, immigrants aren't taking all of our jobs, and not everything is Obama and Hillary Clinton's fault, despite the Idiot's claim that <span>"It's(The Obama Administration) failed them at every level."</span>  This Idiot made a rambling speech at the RNC about how bad things are, how he alone can fix everything as fast as snapping your fingers, <span>"Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,"</span> all while accusing Democrats of destroying the very fabric of this nation.  Last time I checked, the Economy is better than it was in 2008, people have more rights, more access to healthcare and believe it or not, more safe than in 2008.  America is not perfect, but it's not a war zone <span>"There are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world. You go to places like Oakland. Or Ferguson. The crime numbers are worse. Seriously."</span>, and insulting our Armed forces <span>"Our military is a disaster,"</span>, our Generals <span>He's (General John Allen) a failed general,"</span> and American citizens <span>"I Love the Poorly Educated,"</span> is as un-American as you can get.</p>

		<h4>This Idiot is UGLY</h4>
</div>
<h3>On Honesty</h3>
<p>The Idiot is flat out wrong on honesty.  He's a con-artist and a fraud, plain and simple.  He stole millions of dollars from people through his sham of a University while pretending it wasn't true <span>"We (Trump University) have an 'A' from the Better Business Bureau,"</span> told people he'd love for a housing bubble to occur to reap the benefits, <span>"I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy,"</span> and refused to pay contractors for work they did on his crappy Bankrupted buildings.  The Idiot pretends to be an outsider <span>"I'm self-funding my own campaign,"</span> but his opinions can be bought, <span>"I, on the other hand, received the early and strong endorsement of the National Rifle Association."</span>  The Idiot even thinks he's attractive despite his ridiculous hair and ugly looking chin, <span>"It is very hard for them to attack me on looks, because I am so good looking."</span> He helped the USFL win a landmark $1 from a lawsuit against the NFL, terrorized renters on his properties in the 80s to force them out, and continues to hire employees as cheap as he can to pocket the extra dough.</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>When it's all said and done, this Idiot is the worst Presidential nominee in the history of the United States.  He is a historically awful, pathetic, stupid, bigoted, racist, tyrannical, misogynist, narcissistic, greedy, selfish, untrustworthy piece of shit.  I'm tired of hearing about him.  I'm tired of his stupid games.  I'm tired of everything about him.  He has completely destroyed the Republican Party as we know it, for better or for worse.  Electing him President will start a World War, crash our Economy into a complete Depression, make all of us extremely unsafe, and worst of all, make America look like a complete f**in' joke.  America is better than this.  I hope you all join me and boycott his name and start calling him The Idiot.  We must do everything we can to make sure he doesn't take over the United States.</p>
