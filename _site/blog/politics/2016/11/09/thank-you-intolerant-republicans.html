<p> Thank you Intolerant Republicans for ruining the country I used to think was fair and open minded.  Thanks to your extreme intolerance, you all have turned our country into a cesspool of fear, hate and bigotry.  Anyone with a differing view from you Intolerant Republicans is deemed problematic, awful and un-American.  Now that America has voted Dictator Donald Trump as President, I no longer feel safe or welcomed by the Federal Government.  As such, this will be my last political post, which is fine because Dictator Trump has completely ruined the country as we know it.  I am done with believing the Government will ever work for all Americans.  Extremism is the problem, not the solution, and anyone who thinks this type of change is good for us is biased and ignorant.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/barack-obama.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Barack Obama" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Barack Obama will be my President, Dictator Trump is not my President and will never be my President</h4>
</div>
	<p>Some people call it change:  I call it intolerance.  The people who voted for Dictator Trump are the same people who adamantly refused to work with President Obama or consider him their President.  To these people, it was all about race.  Everything is a race issue with them, and having an African American President was unacceptable to them.  Their attacks on him were extremely personal and racist to boot.  From Day One, Republicans in Congress refused to work with Obama, as they made it their mission to make him a one-term president (which failed), imply that his heritage disqualified him (which Dictator Trump led that racist accusation) and obstruct everything Obama had to offer, clearly believing the country was better off horrible than enacting one of his ideas for him to take credit.  Obama reached out to them; they said no, and their supporters were happy with that because they expect things their way and now.  They treated him like shit, called him ‘un-American’ simply for not having the same view as them and refused to believe the obvious facts that he was a Christian from Hawaii, because according to them, if he has a Muslim name, he must be a Muslim.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, these intolerant Republicans don’t care about what anyone else thinks.  They have no problem expressing their “First Amendment” rights, but anyone else that does to argue against them apparently don’t have the same rights.  They’ll discredit them, call them un-American, tell them to leave, and find new and inventive ways to keep their voices from being heard, whether it’s voter suppression or claiming the people actually have a say in the vote for Supreme Court Justice.  What America needs is for all voices to be heard.  But the Intolerant Republicans only want their voice to be heard, and expect everyone else to follow them.  It’s their way or the highway.  Again, it’s not real change; it’s the other side wanting their beliefs and ignore everyone else’s.  Real change actually fixes problem.  Bad change simply changes the burden from one half to the other.</p>
	<p>Being a Jewish minority, I can no longer feel safe due to these intolerant Republicans who assume or expect me to be Christian.  It's sickening enough for people to wish me a Merry Christmas because I look like them.  Religion is not skin-color based and these Intolerant Republicans hate it when people say Happy Holidays, ignorant to the fact that people in the United States have different beliefs and religions.  It's even worse to know those who genuinely hate Jews are all of the sudden more empowered to 'take their country back' from the minorities.  After all, these Ignorant Republicans only get mad when minorities do something wrong.  A white man killing two cops?  Not a problem for them, that guy has gun rights.   A black man killing two cops?  He must be a cop-killer, a gangster and part of Black Lives Matter, a racist organization that promotes violence against cops (it doesn't).   It’s all about white power to them and it disgusts me that this type of behavior is not only not discouraged by them, but rewarded.  Bullying is not something that should be rewarded.  I would get fired by my job, like millions of honest Americans, for saying the racist crap Dictator Trump said during his campaign.  It's pathetic that he had to use this to get attention, as he didn't really need it to begin with.  How can I trust someone who has belittled, insulted and bad-mouth most of America simply to win a race.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Intolerant Republicans out there, I’m just a young Liberal who hates white people for supporting minorities and Jewish, so I must be greedy with money and not a Christian, and since Anthony Weiner is a pervert, I must be a pervert too because I'm Jewish.  I’m a perfectly normal human being who's a model citizen, not greedy nor a pervert.  But the intolerant people who rule this country don’t care what ideas I’d bring to the table; they just see me as a stereotype.  They don’t care about any of the Liberal ideas that mixed with Conservative ideas would actually help this country heal together.  Rather, they’ve started a dangerous back and forth game of who goes the lowest and destroys the country.</p>
<p>So again, thank you Intolerant Republicans for ruining this country.  With complete control, 100% of everything bad that happens to us, and it will be really bad, will be all on your shoulders.  Republicans are the reason our country is in ruins.  True, there are some decent Republicans; Ohio Governor John Kasich, Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and former Secretary of State Colin Powell (who btw did the same thing as Hillary Clinton with those stupid emails) are example of Republicans who give a damn, but the majority hate anyone who opposes them.  They make their opinions before their opponents actually pass their laws, and now that they have all the control to do what they want, they will have to own up to their stupid ideas.  They won't be able to blame Obama, although they will try their damn hardest to blame him for everything like they have been before.  They'll live in their fantasy world where everything they do is right and everything everyone else thinks is wrong.  They want to go to war, they got one, but this is not over and Intolerant Republicans are the problem with this country, not the solution.</p>
