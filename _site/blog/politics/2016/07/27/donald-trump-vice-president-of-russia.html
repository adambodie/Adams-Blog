<p> Last week, just before the Democratic National Convention started, hackers released emails from the DNC pertaining to their head’s plans to push candidate Bernie Sanders out of the race.  The hacks were deemed by U.S. officials as likely the work of the Russians, perhaps in an attempt to sway the election towards Republican Donald Trump.  Now, Donald Trump himself has asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them.  Clearly, Donald Trump prefers Russia over Democrats in the United States.  A man who has repeatedly praised Russia President Vladimir Putin as a great leader and capable of ‘getting stuff done,’ one question remains.  Is Donald Trump working to become President of the United States or the Vice President of Russia?</p>

	<p>Throughout history, Russia, the Soviet Union, whatever they have been called, have been our rivals.  From World War II to the Cold War, relations between us and the Soviet Russians have been frosty at best.  Even after the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union, Russia plays by its own rules and wants world power.  To have American pride, you must be proud of America and all of it, and not say great things about our so-called geo-political foes.  Donald Trump has repeatedly violated this by praising their President while saying nothing but awful things about our President.  If Donald Trump truly hates Obama, he needs to move to Russia where he can shower praise for their President.</p>
	<p>Vladimir Putin is a bully and a tyrant, a man incapable of caring about anyone else and will use anyone that likes him as his play toy.  He is one of the few leaders in the world with less of a soul than Donald Trump.  So it’s not surprising that Donald Trump is kissing his ass.  Trump only cares about power, like Putin does.  It’s no surprise Putin would prefer him over Hillary Clinton.  While Clinton has and will stand up to Putin’s tyrannical ways, Trump will be taken along for a ride until the United States is sold to the Russians.  Trump would probably make billions.</p>
	<p>The fact that Trump would ask the Russians to help him is a clear sign that he’s working with the Russians, whether directly or indirectly, to win the Presidency here, but he’s too naive and stupid to realize that Russia wants us trampled, perhaps the better term would be ‘trumpled.’  Russia has been accused of killing rivals, trampling on human rights and other criminal activities, and while Trump believes every denial from Putin’s mouth, clearly they have similarities, as Trump defrauds, lies and hides everything there is to know about him.  Perhaps Donald Trump’s tax returns would show his true appreciation for Russia and his partnership he wishes to have with them.</p>
	<p>We need a President who puts America First.  Donald Trump claims he’s the only one who puts America first, but his actions have made it clear he’s putting Russia First.  He complains about Hillary and her emails but essentially praises the Russians for breaking the law and encourages them to break the law.  We need someone that will protect us and stand up for us, not a criminal.  This is not the man we need as President of the United States.  If Trump wants to be the Vice President of Russia, please vote Hillary Clinton for President and force him to move there.  He doesn’t belong here!</p>
