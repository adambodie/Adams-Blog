<p> The Republican and Democrat National Conventions have come and gone, officially ending the Primaries.  Seeing bits of each, I can safely say one thing: the two Parties are from two different worlds. One filled with anger and hate, the other filled with love and passion.  So which one better reflects us as a nation?  Here are my thoughts on each convention and my allegiance going forward.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/obama-clinton.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Obama and Clinton" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton</h4>
</div>
<p>The RNC, not surprisingly, was a complete mess, full of hatred and spew.  There were no legitimate complaints about Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, just lies, lies and more lies.  Clearly, the Republicans are full of anger.  For example, Hillary Clinton does not want to get rid of the Second Amendment, yet this was repeated multiple times.  Many of the speakers criticisms were emotionally charged falsehoods that attack their opponents personally without any evidence to back up their claims.  It's been proven for years that Obama has never been a Muslim yet the Right refuses to accept that he is a Christian, claiming he must be a Muslim because of his worldview being so different from theirs.  No matter how hard they try, it will never be true.  That is called RACISM. And Hillary’s emails? Just another distraction from the real issues facing our country and the Republicans lack of substantial ideas.</p>
<p>The main speakers tried to paint Donald Trump in a positive viewpoint; mainly his family, but this is a very limited piece of Donald Trump.  He wants to run this country like his business, not like he treats his family.  His business record speaks for itself.  Bankruptcies, lawsuits, not paying workers and fraud.  And not surprisingly, his family doesn't see this or chooses not to accept this. Melania Trump’s speech was a ripoff of Michelle Obama’s speech at the 2008 DNC; clearly not that smart.  Republicans like Newt Gingrich claim it's not a big deal she plagiarized someone else's speech, but surely he'd cry foul if Hillary Clinton did the same thing. Duh!</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/christie.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Chris Christie" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Chris Christie: Guilty or not guilty of hugging Hillary Clinton?  GUILTY!</h4>
</div>
<p>Some low points include Chris Christie's mock trial for Hillary Clinton.  Chances are, they wouldn't complain about Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice doing the exact same thing as Hillary Clinton did with her stupid emails.  It was stupid, not criminal, but Republican's merely WANTED her to be indicted.  They don't care about the truth.  Coming from an opportunistic ass wipe who rightfully complained about Donald Trump, then starting kissing his feet the moment he dropped out of the Presidential race.  Another low point was Ted Cruz refusing to endorse Donald Trump, leading to boos and anger from a divided crowd.  I don't blame Cruz (for once), after all, Trump made trash TV comments about his family.  It says a lot about the Republicans in general.  With that said, I passionately hate Ted Cruz and will love to see the end of his Political career, hopefully sooner than later.</p>
<p>Which leads us to Donald Trump himself.  After his speech, it's hard to believe he even likes America.  I certainly felt like I wasted my time listening to his ridiculous angry dribble.  He spent his time criticizing everything about us, believing the world is on fire, life is in shambles, and everything is on the verge of collapse.  Not surprisingly, the only thing Donald Trump talked good about was wait for it...HIMSELF.  He believes he's the only one who can fix things, pumps himself up as a Messiah, all while blaming everything on the Democrats.  But Trump has no ideas on how to fix anything.  No plan to defeat ISIS, no plan to help the Economy, Nothing.  His campaign is a joke full of catchphrases, extreme hyperboles, empty promises worth less than a degree from Trump University, hateful rhetoric towards everyone not like him, and all for personal gain. Trump’s vision of this country is blatantly false, dreary and downright scary, and he can't be trusted to fix anything, let alone fix things ‘quickly’.  I certainly don't leave my house everyday wondering if a Terrorist is going to attack me.  I don't have any reason to believe everything wrong with my life is due to Foreigners.  I certainly don't believe a man so secretive can be trusted with doing the dishes, let alone lead our country.  All the nice things said about him really can't be proven, because his public persona is that of an egotistical misogynistic asshole.  I didn't watch the RNC live, I was up thankfully out of town.  I did not miss a thing.  A few stupid clips I saw were downright pathetic.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/clinton-kaine.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine: Real Leaders</h4>
</div>
<p>The DNC was not surprisingly, more kind and accepting towards all people.  They showed appreciation for both the Police and African Americans.  The RNC only likes the Police, vilifying African Americans, particularly Black Lives Matter, as the problem; mere Police Killers. NOT TRUE! Their complaints about Donald Trump were based primarily on his own words, not made up rhetoric based on fiction and selfish desires.  Nope, speaker after speaker referred to Trump's words to critique his plans based on his own words.  After all, he said what he meant, and he meant what he said.  Trump owns his words and ridiculous rhetoric.</p>
<p>The main speakers were ALL supportive of Hillary and described her compassion to fight for progress.  Michelle Obama gracefully attacked Trump as bad for children, using her own thoughts while showcasing her passion for the country she loves.  Bernie Sanders declared Hillary as the only candidate to vote for despite their minor disagreements.  Bill Clinton used his folkish charm to describe his passion for Hillary and Obama strongly rebuked Donald Trump’s version of America as bogus.  Attack after attack on Donald Trump’s twisted world of hate and fear.  That’s the way to do it.  We also can't forget Joe Biden’s attack on Trump’s malarkey and Tim Kaine’s fatherly mocking of Donald Trump’s phrase: Believe Me.  Believe Trump? Not even in Bizarro World.</p>
<p>The DNC covered all factions of potential voters, even the Anti-Trump Republican's who know he’s plagued their Party for years to come.  Speakers like Independent Michael Bloomberg and Retired General John Hutson proclaimed that while Hillary isn't perfect (no one is perfect), she’s the only one remotely qualified for the job.  They reached out to Bernie Sanders biggest fans time and time again, and gave everyone an equal opportunity to represent their views.  None of that at the RNC.  It was all the same viewpoint they shared of doom and gloom.</p>

		<h4>I would cry too, poor kid.</h4>
</div>
<p>I love America, and I'm a proud American. That's why Hillary Clinton’s speech was the obviously better of the two.  It doesn't matter what anyone thinks of her.  She loves this country and will fight to make things better.  I can't say the same about Donald Trump.  He hates this country and thinks everyone a part of it is weak, stupid or detrimental to our society.  He puts himself above all, while Hillary will keep fighting for others.  This is why Republicans hate her so much; her fiery passion is detrimental to their way and her relentlessness is unmatched.  Truth be told, she has more balls than most men, especially easily offended Donald Trump.  No dwelling, just passion to do things the right way.</p>
<p>Congressional gridlock is our biggest problem right now, and only one candidate even sees it as a problem to fix: Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump thinks he can spit in all of Congress’s faces and do whatever he wants.  That's how he has lived his entire life.  Hillary Clinton is willing to work together to get things done.  Working with allies is a solution.  Donald Trump sees this as a problem, alienating everyone of our allies while praising dictators around the world as good leaders.  Obviously a crystal ball into Donald Trump’s leadership skills.</p>
<p>Donald Trump is only right about one thing: We need change.  But we need good change, not bad change.  Good changes defeat terrorists with our allies, strengthens the economy bottom-up and prospers as one.  Trump’s change leads to economic crises, constant attacks from Terrorists using his own words as encouragement and a deeply divided country from which only he benefits from.  Donald Trump is a historically horrific candidate; anyone who actually believes one word out of his mouth is downright stupid.  That’s why the Election is that important and clear who must lead our country to survive. That's why I'm voting Hillary Rodham Clinton for President.  Thank you and good night.</p>
