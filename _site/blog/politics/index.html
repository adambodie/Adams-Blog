        <p class="intro">Three months from today, on November 8th, the country I call home, the United States of America, will elect a new President. Our country's future is at stake. On one hand is Hillary Clinton, Former First Lady, Senator of New York and Secretary
            of State. On the other hand is Donald Trump, who can simply be described as a Tyrannical Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig. I am sick and tired of hearing about this fool. Everything he says is stupid, childish and filled with hate. There are a
            plethora of reasons not to vote for this degenerate, I've managed to find one-hundred reasons, but the reasons don't stop there. He has zero qualities of a worthy President and even less qualities of a proud American. This is why I am taking
            a pledge to no longer refer to him by his name and pledge to start calling him simply as The Idiot.</p>

        <p class="intro">The Republican and Democrat National Conventions have come and gone, officially ending the Primaries. Seeing bits of each, I can safely say one thing: the two Parties are from two different worlds. One filled with anger and hate, the other filled
            with love and passion. So which one better reflects us as a nation? Here are my thoughts on each convention and my allegiance going forward.</p>

        <p class="intro">Last week, just before the Democratic National Convention started, hackers released emails from the DNC pertaining to their head’s plans to push candidate Bernie Sanders out of the race. The hacks were deemed by U.S. officials as likely the work
            of the Russians, perhaps in an attempt to sway the election towards Republican Donald Trump. Now, Donald Trump himself has asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them. Clearly, Donald Trump prefers Russia over Democrats
            in the United States. A man who has repeatedly praised Russia President Vladimir Putin as a great leader and capable of ‘getting stuff done,’ one question remains. Is Donald Trump working to become President of the United States or the Vice
            President of Russia?</p>

        <p class="intro">Enough is enough. For so long, our country has turned a blind eye on racism, proclaiming that it's not a big deal like it used to be, just because of Civil Rights and the elimination of Jim Crow laws. But recent events, particularly the deaths
            of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas have shown just how horrific racism in the United States really is. Is there a coincidence that this is happening
            now at this current time? Of course not. This is a by-product of the anger and race baiting politics that Donald Trump has shoved down America's throats.</p>

        <p class="intro">In an election where Donald Trump has seemingly offended just about everyone that's not an old white Christian, it was only inevitable that Donald Trump would be accused of Anti-Semitism. With all the Islamophobia Donald Trump keeps spreading,
            it's hard to forget that the Jews have historically been hated on by the majority of non-Jews. Recently, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with money in the background and a Star of David symbol proclaiming 'Most Corrupt Candidate
            Ever.' Trump took it down two hours later and replaced it with a circle replacing the Jewish Star. Does this make Donald Trump Anti-Semitic or just plain stupid. Here are my thoughts on Trump's history of Anti-Semitism.</p>

            team lose an epic upset to Iceland in Euro 2016, I've decided to say a few words based solely so I can use the following joke: England just brexited Euro 2016. The timing couldn't be any better. Here are my thoughts on Brexit.</p>

            Pulse. Like most, I despise terrorism and hate whenever it occurs. But stopping terrorism here in the United States and the world requires our nation and our allies to come together. But instead, we have our Republican congressmen and wannabe

            man-made climate change, mostly members of the Republican Party.</p>

            The Republican’s presumptive candidate is Donald Trump, billionaire entrepreneur and reality TV star. I will never vote for Donald Trump; he attracts the worst kind of attention and has led the most hateful campaign ever. But it was much more
            difficult to choose between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, her Democrat competition for the Democratic nominee. Though both candidates have their strengths and weaknesses, in the end I am throwing my support behind Mrs. Hillary Clinton.</p>

        <p class="intro">I've seen and read about many bad politicians in my lifetime. Former Senator Trent Lott, who in 2002 claimed we’d be better off had we voted for racist Senator Strom Thurmond is one. Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich attempts to sell Obama’s
            Senate seat and other criminal activities is another. Former Florida Congressman Mark Foley and his sexually explicit texts to teenage boys was also disturbing, along with the many congressmen and politicians who’ve cheated on their spouses,
            i.e. Newt Gingrich, Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner. But despite all those with questionable ethics, criminal policies and downright slanderous misgivings, no politician has or ever will be more pathetic, manipulative, uncooperative or untrustworthy
            than Senator Ted Cruz.</p>

            and who can and can’t enter them. To hear North Carolinians talk, it’s no longer safe to go into a restroom without wondering who might sneak up from behind and attack you. You might as well not use public restrooms at all in the state of
            North Carolina, because suddenly, there has been an increase of men going into women’s restrooms and attacking them, except for the fact, of course, that men aren’t illegally going into women’s restrooms and they’re definitely not attacking
            them. So why all the hubbub over restrooms?</p>

            (i.e Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012 on the Republican side), it does say something about each party in general. With all of that said, the top two ranked Republican candidates in Iowa, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have pushed
            the bounds on extremism and pure hatred. It's no wonder establish Republicans are actively concerned about these two winning the Republican nomination, as some Republicans are smarter than others.</p>

        <p class="intro">On January 2nd, 2016, a group of militiamen, led by Ammon Bundy, the son of famed anti-government law breaking tax cheat Cliven Bundy, took over a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon. Though Burns is on the
            other side of the state (and a completely different world than where I live), it's insulting that these idiots are fighting to 'save' two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, whom have accepted their faiths to report to prison for their
            crimes and it's even stupider that these anti-government wackos think that they can do whatever they want as long as they wave their guns and American flags in the name of freedom.</p>

        <p class="intro">Dear America: We have an epidemic occurring through our nation and despite repeated outbreaks, none of our leaders are willing to figure a way to get it done. In fact, many of them don't think we should do anything at all. That epidemic of course,
            is gun violence. So please America, let's have an honest conversation on how to best handle gun violence and stop with the lies upon lies we keep hearing.</p>

        <p class="intro">Next year, the United States will elect a new president to lead our country. We have many candidates to choose from. Unfortunately, politics, campaigns and spending bring out lots of ugly, negative comments, childish bickering and aiming for the
            lowest common denominator attempts to attract voters. Not surprisingly, one candidate stands out in this department, a man obsessed with himself, always trying to gain attention by any means necessary, and a firm believer of 'no news is bad
            new,' That man of course, is a man famous for building a rich empire and starring in reality TV shows, Donald Trump.</p>

        <p class="intro">There are plenty of people who are afraid of people who aren't like them, and it makes me sick to read. Diversity is one of the greatest things about the United States. We have lots of ethnicities, religions, identities, etc. I, for one, am proud
            to be an American that accepts all races, religions, etc. We need to embrace others, not fear those who are not like us.</p>
