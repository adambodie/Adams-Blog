<p> <strong>4:32 pm - </strong>Tonight is the 2016 NBA Draft, where the young stars join their new teams.  For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like they did last year with D'Angelo Russell.  While Russell wasn't an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype.  Who will the Lakers take with the number 2 picks.  All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be announced in 10 minutes.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/brandon-ingram.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Brandon Ingram." class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Here's hoping Brandon Ingram is the next Lakers All-Star</h4>
</div>
	<p><strong>4:37 pm - </strong>The first pick is announced, and no surprise, it's Ben Simmons, the Australian sensation from LSU.  I would have loved for the Lakers to get this kid, has lots of potential, but no surprise he goes to Philadelphia.  Maturity issues aside, this kid has great skills.  With Philadelphia done with its rebuilding project, he can be the anchor for a franchise desperate for some wins.  They deserve some brotherly love, lol.</p>
	<p><strong>4:43 pm - </strong>The Lakers have the second pick, and they take Brandon Ingram, with little surprise.  Ingram is a natural replacement to Kobe with his size and length, along with his shooting and perimeter skills.  Though I think Buddy Hield has potential to be a superstar and would have loved to see him taken by the Lakers, Ingram is the safer pick.  He's a little skinny, but so was Durant as a young'un.  It's too early to give up on D'Angelo Russell.  Hearing ESPN take about a fantasy trade of Russell for Okafor is quite ironic.  Most people thought they would take Okafor but took Russell instead.  Equally ironic that Philadelphia is trying to trade him now, and rumbles about Russell with both two having character issues.  Boston has the third pick, a huge steal from Brooklyn from the Pierce-Garnett trade.  They're trying to get a veteran for the pick.  Now the drama begins.</p>
	<p><strong>4:51 pm - </strong>Danny Ainge is known for trades in the drafts, they have a bright future with Isaiah Thomas at the point guard, a great coach with Brad Stevens and plenty of cap room to make deals.  Kris Dunn, Buddy Hield, Jamal Murray, someone else.  Yep, it's Jaylen Brown from California.  A surprise to some, but I think Brown has potential to be a star.  Boston doesn't need a point guard and big men are missing at the top of the draft list.  I suspect Boston will keep him.</p>
	<p><strong>4:53 pm - </strong>Phoenix has the fourth pick, and it's unknown which direction they will go.  Eric Bledsoe is talented but injury-prone, while they traded the wrong point guard by sending Isaiah Thomas to acquire Brandon Knight.  Random Boston thought, Jaylen Brown was the captain of his chess team in middle school?!?  Wow!  But back to Phoenix, they have decent players but weren't healthy.  I think Buddy Hield would be great for Phoenix, but Phoenix needs size, so a bigger man might be on the horizon.  Marquese Chriss from Washington, Dragan Bender, the Croatian Man of Mystery?</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/dragan-bender.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Dragan Bender." class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Bonus points for playing in Israel, Dragan Bender.</h4>
</div>
	<p><strong>4:58 pm - </strong>And with the fourth pick, Phoenix selects...Dragan Bender, the Croatian Man of Mystery, who last played for Maccabi Tel Aviv, Israel's best team.  He's only 18, so he didn't play that much according to the ESPN announcers.  Bonus points for playing in Israel.  Will he be the next Kristaps Porzingis (the fourth pick last year) or the next Darko Milicic?  We'll have to wait and see.  Either way, Minnesota has the fifth pick, and they need a point guard with a shot.  Buddy Hield is realistic, but Providence point guard Kris Dunn is the highest rated point guard in the draft, with defensive capabilities, which is new coach Tom Thibodeau's calling card.  We'll find out after the break.</p>
	<p><strong>5:06 pm - </strong>Minnesota's pick is in, and they select...Kris Dunn, the guard from Providence.  Sorry John Calipari, but Kris Dunn is the perfect choice for Tom Thibodeau.  Whether he becomes a star, who knows, I don't know much about his game, but Minnesota has a bright future with Andrew Wiggins, Karl-Anthony Towns and Zach Lavine.  Now New Orleans has the sixth pick.</p>
	<p><strong>5:09 pm - </strong>New Orleans needs some guards to complement Anthony Davis.  A disappointing season last year, Davis clearly needs someone else who can perform consistently.  Aaron Gordon, Tyreke Evans and Jrue Holiday have been all inconsistent.  Oh, and Kris Dunn has some shiny shoes courtesy of JC Penneys.  Yippee.  But sad childhood story for Dunn, he deserves credit.  Hope he helps the Timberwolves out.  Back to New Orleans, they need Buddy.  And watching the NBA Reporter Alert on ESPN, it appears that's the direction they're going.  Official announcement waiting.</p>
	<p><strong>5:13 pm - </strong>And they took Buddy Hield with the sixth pick.  Great pick for New Orleans, and a perfect fit for them.  I like this kid's shooting and spunk.  Steph Curry-like potential, clearly the player New Orleans needs to complement Anthony Davis.  And he's a Senior, so there's plenty of experience there.  They just compared him to Voshon Lenard, there's a name I haven't heard in years.  Gotta love the Bahamas spirit the Buddy Hield brings.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/dunn-kris-gucci.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kris Dunn's Shoes" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Look at Kris Dunn's shoes.  Wow!</h4>
</div>
	<p><strong>5:17 pm - </strong>Denver has the seventh pick, and they have no direction.  They don't have a star, a bunch of talented B star players like Kenneth Faried and Danilo Galinari.  They haven't had a star since they traded Carmelo Anthony (this pick was part of that trade).  The jury's still out on Emmanuel Mudiay, so Denver can go anywhere with this pick, but appear set on Kentucky's Jamal Murray (now John Calipari can stop lobbying this kid).  He almost went to Oregon, but ended up at Kentucky with Coach Cal.  Yet Oregon made it to the Elite Eight and was a #1 seed.  But anyways...</p>
	<p><strong>5:21 pm - </strong>Denver took Jamal Murray, the best rated player left in the draft.  Calipari believes he will lead all rookies in scoring.  We'll see, but I can't stand Calipari.  I've mentioned him more times than any other coach in this blog.  For Denver, nice pick, but they need direction and a cornerstone.  His comparison, Michael Redd, another player who I haven't heard about in a long time.</p>
	<p><strong>5:23 pm - </strong>Now we come to the most dysfunctional team in the NBA, the Sacramento Kings.  Anyone who thought George Karl would mesh with DeMarcus Cousins is clearly stupid, as their issues clouded everything with that franchise.  Cousins is the best pure center in the NBA, Sacramento made a mistake firing Michael Malone two years ago.  But David Joerger makes sense as a coach for Cousins.  Rajon Rondo looked decent as their point guard, and they still have Rudy Gay, though he's likely trade bait.  WIth a nice new simple logo, who should Sacramento take?</p>
	<p><strong>5:26 pm - </strong>Sacramento takes Marquese Chriss, the power forward from the Washington Fuskies.  He gets the stay in purple, but I don't know much about him or his game, since Washington is still lagging behind Oregon.  But they're trading this pick to the Phoenix Suns, who are getting Marquese Chriss and Dragan Bender, according to ESPN's Andy Katz.  Phoenix has purple too.  First trade of the night!  According to the stats, Marquese Chriss got more fouls than anyone else in the history of the world it seems.  No one ever talks about foul stats.  No wonder I don't know about him.  I doubt he would've done much for Sacramento, and I would be surprised if he becomes anything more than an average player.</p>
	
	<p><strong>5:31 pm - </strong>Toronto, fresh off their best season ever, has the ninth pick, courtesy of the New York Knicks via Denver.  If DeMar DeRozan doesn't bolt, their first priority, Toronto will still contend in the East.  They shockingly beat the Cavs two times in the Eastern Conference Finals.  They select Jakob Poeltl, the University of Utah Austrian sensation.</p>
	<p><strong>5:33 pm - </strong>Jakob Poeltl played well at Utah, but didn't do much against Oregon in the Pac-12 Conference Championship game.  He was the Pac-12 Player of the Year.  Toronto is a good place for him; they don't need immediate contributions from 'the best Austrian import since the Von Trapp family.'  International player going to Toronto, perfect!  Now the tenth pick, Milwaukee.  Commercial!</p>
	<p><strong>5:40 pm - </strong>Milwaukee has the tenth pick, another disappointment this year, the Bucks need some shooters but the highest rated players are bigs, and they need rebounding as well.  Steph Curry made more three pointers in 2016 than the entire Milwaukee Bucks team in 2016.  Milwaukee can go anywhere, and they select...Thon Maker, the super mysterious Power Forward from Australia, whose age is in question.  Born in Sudan and escaped at the age of 6, moved to Australia for 8 years, moved to the United States at 14, then moved to Canada.  That's a mouthful.  A high risk-high reward type of player, with the mystery angle the biggest issue.  The buzz word the analysts said is 'unique.'  He definitely appears unique from everything they've said about him.  Similar to Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Greek Freak, Thon Maker is technically the only high school player in the draft, albeit a very odd way.  It's 5:44 pm and I'm hungry for dinner, so now it's time for hot dogs.  I'll be back soonâ€¦</p>
	<h3>I'm back!</h3>
	
	<p><strong>7:05 pm - </strong> I'm back for a rundown of all the things I missed while I was making dinner, eating dinner, doing the dishes, and because it's trash night, took out the trash.  Here we go:  Orlando took Arvydas Sabonis's kid Domantas Sabonis with the 11th pick.  If only he was like his Dad in his prime.  Another reminder of what could have been for the Blazers with Arvydas Sabonis.  Even more shocking, Orlando traded him, Victor Oladipo and Ersan Ilyosava to Oklahoma City for Serge Ibaka!  The first major trade of the night.  I always felt OKC needed to trade Ibaka to become truly elite.  They fell just short against Golden State, and whether Kevin Durant comes back or not is the biggest mystery in the NBA period.  But Ibaka, though talented, was expendable for OKC.  He became a jump shooter when he would have been better as an interior player for OKC's sake.  They traded James Harden just to keep Ibaka...Chicago took Denzel Valentine with the 14th pick.  Nice tough kid from Michigan State who cost me street cred for losing to Middle Tennessee State in the NCAA tournament.  But Chicago is rebuilding, with Derrick Rose being traded to the Knicks...Atlanta took DeAndre Bembry from St. Joseph's with the 21st pick.  I liked his game when he played against Oregon in the NCAA Tournament, a street-smart player with the best afro since Josh Childress back in 2004 (who was also taken by the Atlanta Hawks).  A surprisingly high number of international players taken, including...Georgios Papagiannis (Greece), Juan Hernangomez (Spain), Guerschon Yabusele (France), Ante Zizic (Croatia), and just taken by Philadelphia with the 24th pick, TimothÃ© Luwawu-Cabarrot (France) - <strong>7:18 pm</strong>  - I've never heard of any of these players, I figured these are the types of players taken in the second round.  If one of those players pans out, I'll be the first to salute them, guarantee.  Oh, and Furkan Korkmaz (Turkey) with the 26th pick by wait for it...Philadelphia again!</p>
			<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
			<img src="/img/deandre-bembry.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="DeAndre Bembry" class="image block img-responsive" />
			<h4>Look at DeAndre Bembry's Afro!</h4>
		</div>
	<p><strong>7:39 pm - </strong> Three picks left in the first round, who wants to bet at least one of them will be an International player?  With the last three picks from Phoenix, San Antonio and Golden State, chances are high.  8 (true) International players already in the first round, tying an NBA record, with a chance to be broken.  The draft hosts are talking about college freshman being able to come back to school if they aren't taken in the first round.  Bad idea, then everyone would enter the NBA Draft, leaving their schools in the balance.  Players should own their decisions of leaving and staying in the draft.  Now we get a Raef LaFrentz reference for Phoenix's 28th pick, Skal Labissiere from Kentucky.  Ouch!  His family survived the Haiti earthquake, how sad.  And he's wearing a pink suit too.  Is pink the new black?  The last time the Spurs had a second-to-the-last first round pick, they took Tony Parker.  They always find steals, except Ian Mahmimi.  As for tonight, they selected Dejounte Murray, point guard for the Fuskies.  Seriously?  Oregon made it to the Elite Eight and it's Washington with two first round picks?  I digress.</p>
			<div class="blog-pic">
			<img src="/img/timothe-luwawu-cabarrot.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="TimothÃ© Luwawu-Cabarrot" class="image block img-responsive" />
			<h4>Pink uniforms?!?  Only a Frenchman can pull it off.  Thanks TimothÃ© Luwawu-Cabarrot!</h4>
		</div>
	<p><strong>7:51 pm - </strong> One more pick in the first round, one more chance for a foreign player to be selected to set the record.  And it's Golden State, who lost the same amount of games in the postseason as they did in the regular season, 9.  All the hard work in the regular season, one win away from winning the championship, and they lost three straight to Cleveland, without an answer to stop superhuman LeBron James and Kyrie Irving.  They threw their chance away like Steph Curry did his mouthguard after fouling out and getting ejected from Game 6 of the Finals.  They acted overconfident and played overconfident.  Cleveland deserved the title and outplayed them.  Brief note, Dejounte Murray's shoes looked like girls shoes, but it's to honor a cousin who died last summer.  I'll give credit for that.  But the final pick of the first round is in, and it's..................Damian Jones, a center from Vanderbilt.  So much for my International player.  Time for the second round.  And I'm done for the night.  Will Oregon's Elgin Cook get selected?  Who will the Lakers take in the second round?  Those questions aren't blog worthy.  Good night!</p>
	<p>Editors Note: The University of Washington's nickname is purposely misspelled as Fuskies, that was by choice from the old days at Oregon when people would say "Huck the Fuskies."</p>
