<p>Super Bowl 50 is on its way, featuring a match-up of the NFL's top two defenses, the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers (1 and 2 respectively). The biggest headline will likely be the probable MVP this year, Carolina QB Cam Newton, a very talented but cocky player. There are quite a few people that find Cam Newton obnoxious and arrogant, whether it's his me-first attitude or his 'Dab' dancing whenever he scores a touchdown. But on the other hand, how can you hate someone with a smile like his?</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>Look at that smile!</h4>
</div>

<p>Offensively, Carolina features a wide variety of weapons, most notably, of course, Cam Newton, who not only has a great arm but also runs the ball quite well.  Plus at his size, he's hard to bring down.  It's the main reason Cam Newton is likely to be named MVP.  Jonathan Stewart is also a threat at the running back position, finally blossoming after Carolina ditched the two-back system with equally talented but different DeAngelo Williams.  Carolina has quite a few receivers capable of getting yardage, but Newton's favorite target is his tight end Greg Olsen, one of the better tight ends in the league.  But at the end of the day, it's all the man with the deceiving smile that is the team's most dangerous player.</p><p>Denver's offense on the other hand has been a big disappointment compared to years past, with Peyton Manning throwing numerous touchdowns and gaining multiple yards.  This year, Peyton Manning, in what may be his last season, has been inconsistent at best, injured for six games, and at the last game of the regular season, a backup for the first time since he was a freshman in college.  Peyton did replace Brock Osweiler in that game and provided a needed spark, allowing him to regain his starting spot back, but Denver's offense isn't quite what it's used to be.  Their running game has been their most consistent part of their game, with Ron Hillman and C.J. Anderson splitting carries.  Their receivers, though talented, including Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, have not made the catches need to sustain long drives.</p>

<p>The clear edge on offense belongs to Carolina, with Cam Newton, the likely MVP, able to hurt you in many ways, with his arm, legs and size.  But what about the team's defense's.  Who has the edge here.</p>

	<h4>Yet Peyton makes you laugh!</h4>
</div>

<p>Denver enters the Super Bowl with the NFL's top ranked defense.  I have never seen a defense defend Tom Brady and his high flying passing attack better than Denver did on Sunday.  They got all kinds of pressure on Brady and sacked him multiple times.  Led by Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware on the defensive line, and with Aqib Talib and Chris Harris Jr. in the Secondary, Denver hopes to prove that defense wins championships.  With that said, they haven't faced a Quarterback with the dual-threat capabilities like Cam Newton.  They may get deceived by that smile.</p>

<p>While Denver's defense is ranked number 1, Carolina's defense is ranked number 2.  Led by Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis (who broke his hand in the NFC Championship game and is questionable for the Super Bowl), Carolina is equally ferocious and capable of slowing down a high powered offense.  They pressured Carson Palmer on Sunday and forced him to throw four interceptions (a sure sign of a bad day) and never looked back in that game.</p>

<p>So who has the better defense?  Both Denver and Carolina have superb defense's, but Carolina gets a slight edge because they don't have to face Cam Newton.  If anyone can slow him down, Denver's the team, but questions remain.  Both teams have good special teams, with accurate kickers and good punters.  Carolina has the edge with Ted Ginn Jr as its punt/kick returner, one of the most dangerous in the NFL.  Both coaches are making their Super Bowl debut, neither one has an edge.</p>

<p>Both teams have plenty of motivation.  Carolina, despite finishing 15-1 in the regular season, was often seen as a fluke more than a legit title contender.  They were even viewed as underdogs against the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round.  What did Carolina do in that game?  Score 31 points in the first half while making Seattle look pathetic.  Seattle responded in the second half but still, it was over before the second half.  They've never won a Super Bowl in franchise history, and with their young players in it for the first time, their motivation is pretty high.  But don't forget Denver.  They too were disrespected in the postseason.  Almost no one saw them beating the mighty Patriots, yet their top ranked defense flexed its muscles and slowed down Tom Brady and company.  Though they've played and won Super Bowl's before, this could very well be Peyton Manning's last game.  What better way for Peyton and the Broncos to finish the season (and his career) than being Champions?  It's the best way to end a wonderful career.  Both teams have a lot to play for in Super Bowl 50.  Whoever executes the best will be the champion.</p>

<p>So about that smile… There are plenty of reasons not to like Cam Newton.  Sure, he did stupid stuff in college.  Stole a laptop while he was at Florida and got kicked off the team.  He wound up at Auburn, won the Heisman and National Championship (sadly against my Oregon Ducks) with lots of controversy over his eligibility.  But every time I see that smile, it makes me feel happy.  I would kill for a smile like that.  So while Cam Newton acts arrogant at times, celebrates too much, and has the me-first attitude that many of the elite NBA players have, look at that smile.</p>

<p>So who wins Super Bowl 50?  To me, it will come down to whether Denver has the ability to slow down Newton.  Denver has the top ranked defense, and defense wins Champions, but Newton is a far different beast than the other quarterbacks Denver has faced, particularly in the postseason.  Carolina's defense should have no problem stopping Denver's mediocre offense, but if Denver can force Newton to make turnovers, it will be a tight game.  Otherwise, I expect Carolina to win easily.  Final score: Carolina 31, Denver 14.  The one thing I can guarantee with Super Bowl 50: Coldplay performing at halftime is going to suck.</p>
