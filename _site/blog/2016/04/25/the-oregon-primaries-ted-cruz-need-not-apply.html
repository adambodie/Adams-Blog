<p>As we're weeks away from Oregon’s Primary election, May 17th, it has become clear that for the first time in ages, Oregonians everywhere will actually have a say for the primaries. As one of the last states, the candidate has typically been decided before April, but this year we’re in a dead heat on both sides of the puzzle. With Kentucky the only other state with their primary the same day, Oregon at last will get the attention it needs for determining each party's nominee for President.</p>

	<h4>Don't we all wish we could do that to Ted Cruz.</h4>
</div>



<p>Obviously, Oregon is a Liberal state; it's going to vote Democrat for the Presidential election no matter who wins the race.  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are the two choices to pick from.  Hillary Clinton stands out as a former Senator, First Lady and Secretary of State, yet her campaign isn't as strong as it should be, with issues of trustworthiness being a big concern.  Bernie Sanders, an Independent Senator from Vermont and admitted Socialist, has come seemingly out of nowhere to pick up support from the Progressives who hate the fact that the system is rigged to favor the millionaires and billionaires.</p>

<p>Yet there are conservatives in Oregon as well, and they have their candidates.  Donald Trump leads the way with his big mouth and frequent racist divisive comments, yet Republicans are trying anything they can to keep him out of office. Ted Cruz, the religious nutcase Senator from Texas who hates to compromise, shows no appreciation for non-conservative thoughts and seems to hate everyone that's not Christian is also in the running. John Kasich, the Governor of Ohio, hangs on by a thread, hoping for a contested convention as he’s only won his home state, despite being the most traditional candidate left and the most reasonable of the bunch.</p>

<p>I can't say I'm excited about any of the candidates, but I know one thing I am determined to see: that neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz get elected as President.  Both of these men (if we can even call them men, they act like a bunch of babies) are ridiculously unqualified and share absolutely pathetic views on the world, not to mention their hate filled speech.  I'm not crazy about either Hillary or Bernie but either one would be an easy choice over those two dweebs. John Kasich is a decent man but is lucky to be where he is and lacks charisma to get people to vote for him.  With the Republicans being so angry, I would be shocked if they settled on Kasich since he’s actually willing to compromise to get things done, an apparent no-no with Republicans these days.</p>

	<h4>Millionaires and Billionaires hate Bernie Sanders.</h4>
</div>


<p>As a native Oregonian, I can tell you proudly that Ted Cruz would not like our state at all, at least the Portland area.  So as news rolled last night that the Kasich and Cruz campaigns have apparently agreed to coordinate primaries to best keep Trump from gaining the magic number of delegates, it was no surprise that Cruz agreed to let Kasich have Oregon and New Mexico in exchange for Indiana.  Whether Cruz actually follows through or stabs Kasich in the back as he does with everyone else remains to be seen, but Cruz has no chance to win Oregon’s Republican primary.  With the largest percentage on non-religious people per capita in the state and a largely Progressive population, Ted Cruz would have a better chance convincing Oregonians he’s actually a woman than he does of convincing them to vote for him.  For once, I’ll thank Ted Cruz for not even bothering showing up to my home state.  It’s embarrassing enough to have him living in the same country as I do.</p>

<p>Our system for electing politicians, creating rules and regulations and basically everything tied to the government is broken, corrupt and filled with greed.  Bernie Sanders has emphatically made that the centerpiece of his campaign, and I have much respect for Bernie for mentioning this as the big problem.  With the passing of Citizens United in 2010 allowing unlimited cash flow to campaigns, it’s easy for those without money to get any say at all, having their voices drowned out by money and big corporations.  Gerrymandering congressional districts designed to drown out minority voters, prejudice tactics to keep people from voting and congressional rules that prevent bills from even reaching the floor have turned our system into a cesspool for corruption.  Bernie Sanders inspires people to understand the voice for the common man, which is why people are enthusiastic for him.</p>

<p>But the downside to Bernie Sanders is his ideas of fixing the broken system.  I wish we could live in a Utopia like he offers, with free healthcare, free college tuition, $15.00 plus minimum wage, and a total dismantling of the millionaires and billionaires of Wall Street.  But it’s never going to happen.  We’re always going to have Republicans on the other side who find these ideas too expensive and burdensome for the wealthy.  Like it or not, some Republicans have decent ideas and fiscally speaking, they’re worth at least exploring as a compromise; unfortunately, their voices are drowned out by the extremists unwilling to negotiate and expecting their way.  This is where Bernie Sanders ultimately fails to me.  I don’t see him having the balls to be aggressive and standing up to these Republicans if leading the way.  Another issue I have with Bernie is my appreciation for moderation.  Nothing about Bernie economically says moderation.  It’s all about attacking Wall Street and their rich snobs.  While it’s true they are driven by greed and power, I also find it necessary for us to work together, not pit sides against another.  We need to find ways to work with them for more business friendly ideas to improve the economy.  Like anything, being in the middle represents the best of both worlds, and the only realistic way to get anything done.  To me, Hillary Clinton would be an easy choice for this except for her sometimes brash personality and somewhat goofy immature attitude she displays.</p>

	<h4>Republicans REALLY hate Hillary Clinton.</h4>
</div>


<p>Hillary Clinton, unlike Bernie Sanders, is more well-rounded with experience on all sides of the issues, from economic to foreign policy issues, and clearly has the personality to get things done, never afraid to fight.  But yet her ideas are average at best, as she’s being drawn further to the left to fend off Bernie Sanders’ obvious charismatic ways.  I know Hillary Clinton would be better handled to tackle on foreign policy issues, a big concern of mine with her experience as Secretary of State, and she has more balls to tackle on the Republicans across the aisle, but Republicans have an extreme hatred for Hillary Clinton and would treat her as they have Obama for the past seven years.  Unfortunately, I’m not convinced Hillary would be any more willing to reason with them than they would with her.  During the first Democratic debate, Hillary declared Republicans as her favorite enemy, kind of an immature thing to say to me.</p>

<p>But in terms of ideas, her beliefs are more reasonable, such as improving Obamacare to be more cost friendly rather than completely revamp it as a single-payer system with Medicare for all, which again, sounds nice, but isn’t realistic.  They aren’t nearly as far-fetched as Bernie Sanders extreme ideas.  But yet, Hillary doesn’t excite me at all.  Her personality is a turnoff for me, and I do consider her somewhat of an opportunist, changing beliefs to better fit her electorate rather than being the more centrist Democrat her husband Bill was, which made him the best President of my lifetime, in my opinion (keep in mind I was born in the Reagan days).</p>

<p>I'm confident both races in Oregon will be one-sided.  Oregon is ripe with Progressives who love Bernie.  Most bumper stickers I see are for Bernie Sanders, and it’s no surprise for me.  Bernie will beat Hillary easily, with the young white electorate far outweighing the minority support which Oregon doesn't have much of.  The Republicans are less clear but Donald Trump fits the angry Republicans better than Ted Cruz the religious nutcase.  The fact he would let John Kasich have a better opportunity says that Ted Cruz could never win our state, he could only win the state if he was the only candidate, and even then he would barely beat ‘Other’. So Donald Trump is the likely winner on the Republican side.</p>

<p>In the end, while my heart says Bernie Sanders is the best choice, for understanding people’s frustrations with the system the best, my brain says Hillary Clinton for providing the most realistic approach to solving problems and being the most experienced person to handle our problems.  Whether I should follow my heart or my brain is the big issue I haven't settled completely on yet.  The rest of me says anyone but Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, as those two imbeciles would turn our country into a joke.  In the end, that's the most important thing to me.</p>
