<p> Every year, XXL magazine, a popular hip-hop magazine, releases its annual 'Freshmen Edition,' highlighting young and promising MCs that XXL believes will become big stars in the game.  Like any 'draft,' some become big stars while others never pan out.  I used to get really excited over these lists, but it peaked in 2010, with dope artists like Freddie Gibbs, J. Cole, Wiz Khalifa, Big Sean, Nipsey Hu$$le and Jay Rock still holding some star power in their own and special way.  Nowadays, the list is a reminder of how much of a decline popular hip-hop is.  I wanted to write this when the list first came out in June, but held off to give myself some time to listen to some of these rappers, none of whom were MC's I loved, and only a few I even had songs from.  So who amongst the 2016 list has any credibility?  Here are my thoughts, starting from top left of their cover.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/xxlfreshmancover2016.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="XXL Freshman 2016" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>If this is the future of Hip-Hop, please help me</h4>
</div>
    <p>Desiigner, a young MC from Brooklyn who sounds like a duplicate of Future, a popular Atlanta MC who I consider to be complete trash, hit the scene with a viral hit, Panda earlier in the year.  While the song is addicting and has been in my playlist for its beat and flow, the song itself is admittedly stupid, with nonsensical lyrics and a dumb title.  Legacy, Panda, Huh?  He released a song called Timmy Turner which sounded kinda dorky and too sing-songy.  Though he has a co-sign from Kanye West, the question remains as to whether he really becomes the next Future, trap "king", or Trinidad Jame$, one-hit wonder (whose song "All Gold Everything" landed him a big deal with Def Jam but got dropped shortly after).  Either way, his career will forever be defined by Panda.</p>
    
    <p>Dave East, standing tall and proud at the top of the cover, is this years choice for what I like to call the "Underground Pick," the type of rapper that's strictly for the streets.  Dave East, reppin East Harlem, New York, isn't likely to appear on any mainstream radio stations soon, but will get his attention from those strictly from the underground.  Dave East is no exception to this rule, a raw street rapper that scored a record deal with Nas' Mass Appeal Records.  Dave East, though needing some polish, is one of the standout members on this list, though I wouldn't call any of these rappers can't miss.  East has some potential, with great tracks like the Nas assisted "Forbes List" and "KD."</p>
    
    <p>Denzel Curry, with the dreadlocks, is nothing special to me.  Unlike some of the rappers on this list, he actually raps, which is a positive, but he is just average to me, which being from the Miami area, isn't totally surprising.  I like the song "Zenith" with Joey Bada$$ and he doesn't do a particularly bad job on the track, but I mainly like Joey Bada$$.  His name makes me think of Denzel Washington and Steph Curry, that's probably the best thing he has going for him, but his style isn't particularly special, though there are far worse artists on the list.</p>
    
    <p>Lil Yachty, otherwise known as the dude with the ugly red beads in his hair, was chosen as the "People's Champ."  Frankly, I have no clue why anyone would listen to this guy.  He mostly sings like crap and has no talent whatsoever.  And why is this guy obsessed with boats?  It's guys like Lil Yachty that make rap so awful sometimes.  I try to keep an open mind, but this guy is just a bad singing loser with little rapping.  It's also dumb for an Atlanta rapper to rap about how cold Minnesota is (don't listen to his song "Minnesota," it's awful).</p>
    
    <p>Lil Dicky, the goofy looking white rapper of the bunch, reppin' the Philadelphia area, is exactly that, a goofy white rapper.  Starting off as a comedian but unsuccessful with that career, he turned to rapping to express he comedic chops, and for the most part, it works for him, as he rhymes about silly things but doesn't take himself too serious.  Songs like "Professional Rapper" showcase him trying to fill a niche as a funny-guy rapper rapping back and forth with Snoop Dogg, making the song quite interesting.  He also has the creative means with videos like his early viral hit "Ex-Boyfriend," where he raps about how huge his girlfriend's ex's package is.  Lil Dicky might be silly but he's smart enough to know he's silly.</p>
    
    <p>Lil Uzi Vert, another rapper with the name Lil, and like Lil Yachty, with ugly braids, his more purple.  Also from Philadelphia, but with a far stupider name than Lil Dicky.  What does Uzi Vert even mean?  Another sing-songy rapper with dumb lyrics and no real talent, although his hit song "Money Longer" at least has a nice beat and is catchy enough to listen to.  Otherwise, who cares.</p>
    
    <p>G Herbo, previously known as Lil Herb, is an authentic Chicago street rapper that's part of the rising genre of the so-called Chi-Raq Drill music.  G Herbo's name is kind of lame, ironically I liked Lil Herb better (despite the plethora of 'Lil' rappers), but there are far worse rappers then him on this list.  Though a far cry from the past legends, G Herbo is better than the previous Drill rappers that have appeared on this list (i.e. Chief Keef, Lil Bibby, Lil Durk) and has some potential.  I heard him on Common's song "The Neighborhood" a few years back and liked what he brought to the song, he probably should've made this list in 2014 instead of friend Lil Bibby.  But better late than never.</p>
    
    <p>Anderson .Paak came out of nowhere last year to make not one, not two, (we know the game), but six appearances on Dr. Dre's final album, Compton, where Anderson .Paak's unique singing ability and occasional raps made him a hot commodity, eventually landing a deal with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Records.  Reppin' Oxnard, California, Anderson .Paak further proved his talents with his major label debut "Malibu," which along with multiple guest appearances here and there make him a bright star in the future.  But primarily an R&amp;B singer, does he really belong on this list, or is this a sign of things to come with the decline of rapping and more singing based raps as many past and present Freshmen have shown.  Either way, with some of the garbage on this list, it's somewhat ironic that Anderson .Paak finds himself as one of the more talented members of this list.</p>
    
    <p>21 Savage, the crazy looking guy with the cross tattoo on his forehead, was someone I never heard of prior to this list coming out.  With a few rappers rejecting a spot on the list (Tory Lanez, Bryson Tiller, Post Malone), it seems likely to me 21 Savage made the list as an alternate.  Listening to him, I can confirm that, as he's nothing special.  He sounds gruff but does nothing with it.  Just another typical lame Atlanta rapper with no lyrics.</p>
    
    <p>Kodak Black, whose hair style is indescribable and god awful, makes me think of the scene from "The Nutty Professor" when the comic Reggie (played by Dave Chappelle) has his hat taken off only to reveal a hideous haircut.  Perhaps Kodak Black should have worn a hat, because he is not only untalented as a rapper, but incredibly ugly to boot with that bizarre haircut.  Even worse, he had to audacity to make a mixtape called "Lil B.I.G. Pac," complete with a rip off of The Notorious B.I.G.'s  classic "Ready to Die" album cover but with him and his ugly hairdo as the baby.  It's a shame Biggie and Pac aren't alive to see such awful rappers make a mockery out of them and wipe them off the map.  Why anyone thinks this kid is talented is beyond me, he sounds pretty lame to me, but this Pompano Beach, Florida based rapper, currently in jail for a variety of charges, is an obvious example of why quality rap is harder to find and appreciate these days.</p>
    
    <p>It's times like these that make me appreciate the older rap even more, and even some of the rap I grew up listening to that wasn't so pleasant.  Some of those MC's may have been bad, but at least they are listenable and actually rap.  Many of these new kids being promoted as popular now barely rap and blur the line between rapping and singing.  It really is unfortunate, especially when far better younger MC's are being left off this list time and time again, case in point Mick Jenkins, a young MC from Chicago who has some very thoughtful lyrics relating things to water.  With the quality of rap declining, it's probably better for someone like Mick Jenkins NOT to be on this list.  On the whole, I would say on this list, that Dave East, G Herbo, Lil Dicky and Anderson .Paak are passable, Denzel Curry is okay, Lil Uzi Vert and Desiigner are one-hit wonders, 21 Savage is not good, and Kodak Black and Lil Yachty are awful.</p>
