  <h1>Climate Change and Snow - The Real Story</a></h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">May 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Climate change is real.  97% of all scientists believe the Earth is getting abnormally hotter than usual because of greenhouse gases polluting the Earth.  But there are some people who believe it's a hoax.  Most likely it's to protect their greenhouse gas producing fuels and chemicals.  Others are religious nuts who hate science as it counters religion.  They'll find any excuse to discredit global warming and climate change as to protect their profit, and gain the support of those who disapprove man-made climate change, mostly members of the Republican Party.</p>

  <h1>Why I Voted for Hillary Clinton</a></h1>

  <p class="intro">At the end of this year, the United States is going to elect a new President, as Obama’s two terms reaches its end.  With that said, it’s important to me that we continue to make progress in building our country's economy, security and social progression.  The Republican’s presumptive candidate is Donald Trump, billionaire entrepreneur and reality TV star.  I will never vote for Donald Trump; he attracts the worst kind of attention and has led the most hateful campaign ever.  But it was much more difficult to choose between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, her Democrat competition for the Democratic nominee.  Though both candidates have their strengths and weaknesses, in the end I am throwing my support behind Mrs. Hillary Clinton.</p>

  <p class="intro">Learning new ways to make blog posts or any developing tools in general is something I have always enjoyed.  It's something encouraged by IBM, the parent company I work for.  With that said, I am revamping my blog post as its own entity, rather than part of the Express framework I'm using for Bodie Web Design.</p>

  <h1>Ted Cruz - The Definition of Pathetic</a></h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">May 3, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">I've seen and read about many bad politicians in my lifetime.  Former Senator Trent Lott, who in 2002 claimed we’d be better off had we voted for racist Senator Strom Thurmond is one.  Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich attempts to sell Obama’s Senate seat and other criminal activities is another.  Former Florida Congressman Mark Foley and his sexually explicit texts to teenage boys was also disturbing, along with the many congressmen and politicians who’ve cheated on their spouses, i.e. Newt Gingrich, Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner.  But despite all those with questionable ethics, criminal policies and downright slanderous misgivings, no politician has or ever will be more pathetic, manipulative, uncooperative or untrustworthy than Senator Ted Cruz.</p>

  <p class="intro">Last night was the first round of the NFL Draft, a time for the best ranked prospects to join the NFL, a joyous time for those to hear their name called. Yet in this day and age, being stupid sells, and being stupid on the Internet never goes away no matter how hard you try. That's why all the buzz today is around Laremy Tunsil, a highly ranked offensive tackle who ended up falling to the 13th pick to the Miami Dolphins, as someone allegedly hacked into his Twitter account and posted a video of him smoking a bong through a gas mask earlier in the day.</p>

  <p class="intro">Growing up, I didn't think much of the Los Angeles Clippers. Why should I have? They were a complete joke, a bumbling group of losers who couldn't win squat, couldn't put together a decent roster and worst of all had an incompetent owner who wouldn't spend any money to keep what little talent they had. It wasn't until the other owners handed them Chris Paul in an effort to keep him from being traded to the Laker did the Clippers finally start to look like a real basketball team. But as the Lakers sunk to the floor, have the Clippers overtaken them? Not even close. No matter how talented the Clippers are, they’ll always be in second place, and incapable of winning the title. Whether they like it or not, they are defined by their disgraceful former owner Donald Sterling.</p>

  <h1>The Oregon Primaries - Ted Cruz need not apply</a></h1>

  <p class="intro">As we're weeks away from Oregon’s Primary election, May 17th, it has become clear that for the first time in ages, Oregonians everywhere will actually have a say for the primaries. As one of the last states, the candidate has typically been decided before April, but this year we’re in a dead heat on both sides of the puzzle. With Kentucky the only other state with their primary the same day, Oregon at last will get the attention it needs for determining each party's nominee for President.</p>

  <h1>The Day the Music Died Part 3</a></h1>

  <p class="intro">When people refer to “The Day the Music Died,” they are referring to the tragic death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper when they perished in a plane crash outside of Clear Lake, Iowa on February 3, 1959. Yet years later, we’ve lost many musicians with a far bigger influence. With apologies to Elvis Presley, John Lennon, everyone in the “27 Club” (Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and more recently, Amy Winehouse), we’ve seen two deaths in the music world truly crushing since that day. The second was of course, Michael Jackson’s tragic death on June 25, 2009, and the third was today, as Prince passed away.</p>

  <p class="intro">It’s true what they say, Kobe always know how to put on a show. The second half of his final game was no exception. As I watched Kobe take shot after shot after shot, I wondered if he was really trying to reach 50 points. The announcers mentioned that could be the case in the first quarter. I would have been happy with 40 points. The plan was to sit Kobe the first half of the fourth quarter. That didn’t happen. Suddenly, the race to 50 was on.</p>
