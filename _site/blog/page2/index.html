  <h1>So He Finally Used the A-Word</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">It took sixteen months, but the Idiot finally used the A-word he never likes to use: <strong>APOLOGIZE</strong>.  What did it take for him to apologize?  A video mic drop recording of him saying some incredibly vulgar things about women, essentially bragging about hitting on a married woman and getting away with groping women because he’s a star.  He called it 'locker room banter,' I call it 'words a sexual predator would say.'  Now that he's used the A-word, he can now apologize to everyone he’s offended in his life.  Here's an partial list of everyone owed an apology.  He's offended so many people it's hard to keep track.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Six Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Six for me is Rivalry Week Part 1.  Minnesota hosted Iowa for the Floyd of Rosedale and Oregon hosted Washington, winning twelve in a row against them but looking far worse now than they have at ay time in those twelve years.  As for the the rest of the games, another entertaining variety of match-ups.</p>

  <h1>Sorry Norf Norf Lady</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 6, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Recently, I read about a viral video of a Christian woman, a mother of four, who blogged her video reaction upon listening to a rap song she heard on the radio, rapping the song line by line and getting upset over the lyrics.  The song in question, Norf Norf, by Vince Staples, is a typical example of a gangsta rap song.  Not surprisingly, the woman was quite offended that this song would appear on the radio, proclaiming the songs of the old days are better for kids.  Not surprisingly, that is simply not true, and there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Five Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 1, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Five has plenty of great matchups, with three top ten conference battles for the first time: Stanford at Washington on Friday, Wisconsin at Michigan and Louisville at Clemson.  Meanwhile, it's the battle for the Governor's Victory Bell for Minnesota as they went to Penn State, while Oregon, after a demoralizing loss last week, head to Washington State, where they hope to avoid last years dysentery affected loss to Washington State</p>

  <h1>Liar Liar, Pant is on Fire</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 26, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">People lie, doesn't matter who you are.  But some people lie more than others.  This year, lying has become the new truth-telling, as the Republican candidate for President, whose name won't be mentioned, lies about, well, basically everything.  This is coming from a man who believes it's okay to lie and does so repeatedly and often as possible.  A man so deluded in himself that he complains a mass conspiracy every time someone tells him what he's saying is lying.  He even claims Ted Cruz as the biggest liar of all time with the nickname Lyin' Ted (to be fair, they are both ridiculous liars). With that said, tonight is the first Presidential debate, and one thing is for certain: this Idiot will frequently lie.  If a drinking game would be made out of it, all participants would die of alcohol poisoning. Here's a live look at lie upon lie upon lie..</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Four Thoughts</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 25, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football.</p>

  <h1>Who Killed JonBenét?</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 24, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Twenty years ago, the night after Christmas, six year old JonBenét Ramsey was found murdered in her home, in what has become a bizarre and fascinating case, from the rambling ransom note to the suspicion on the family, there are many odd things about the case that makes it unusual.  Yet after 20 years, no one really knows what happened.  Recently, a new investigator team, with new technology, reanalyzed the evidence and discussed their findings on a CBS special.  So with that all said, who killed JonBenét Ramsey?  Here are all my possible theories, complete with their likelihood of it happening.</p>

  <h1>Skittles - A Poor Analogy to Describe Humanity</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 20, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Today, Donald Trump Jr., son of the racist bigot Idiot whom he's named after, again proved that racism is learned, much like his racist father and grandfather, by making this ridiculous analogy about Syrian refugees: "If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you.  Would you take a handful?"  Aside from being moronic and overly simplistic, statements like this are a perfect example of why racial profiling is flat out wrong.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Three Thoughts</h1>

  	<span class="date">September 17, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week 3, unlike the week before, featured a lot of challenging match-ups, and for the first time ever, the Top 3 ranked teams in the AP poll play on the road against other ranked teams.  Alabama at Ole Miss, Florida State at Louisville and Ohio State at Oklahoma.  Safe to say, champions are made here.  Other plenty of entertaining games abound.  So what happened on Week 3?  Here are my thoughts.</p>

  <h1>Worst Politicians Currently in Office</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 15, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Let's be honest, politics is dumb at its core and politicians are terrible.  Currently, Congress has an approval rating of about 10% or so.  Plenty of our current politicians couldn't figure their way out of a paper bag, much less pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation.  No matter who's elected President, Congress will always find ways to screw things up and stop real progress from happening.  With that said, here are the 15 worst members of Congress, and as an added bonus, the 5 worst Governors.</p>
