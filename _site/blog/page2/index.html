  <h1>What To Think Of Willie Taggart</h1>

  	<span class="date">December 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">The Oregon Ducks have a new football coach, as they announced the hiring of South Florida coach Willie Taggart to become the new coach.  The Ducks interviewed multiple candidates, but in the end, hired Taggart over Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen.  Did the Ducks make the right hire? Here are my thoughts on the new Ducks head coach.</p>

  <p class="intro">Today marked the announcement of all the colorful, albeit way too many, bowl games, most notably the College Football Playoff and New Year's Six games.  The Oregon Ducks weren't eligible, but the Gophers were, so I'll only have one game I need to watch.  Here are my thoughts on the more exciting bowls and playoffs.</p>

  <h1>College Football Championship Week Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">

  	<span class="date">December 3, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Championship Week is here, as most playoff contenders (sorry Ohio State) have one more chance to make that big statement they need to be in the final four.  Who wins, who loses, and who gets left home wishing that they hadn't lost that one game?  Here are my thoughts on the matter.</p>

  <h1>The Brand New Lakers</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 30, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">It's only the end of November, and already, the young new Lakers have proven that not only is the Kobe era over, but that they're much further ahead of schedule than anyone anticipated.  The young Lakers just won a close game in Chicago tonight, with a 10-10 record, already more than half the wins they had all of last year.  The Lakers have been the biggest surprise in the league this year and there are plenty of reasons to love these Lakers.</p>

  <h1>The End of the Rich Brooks Era</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 29, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">For as long as I’ve been a fan of the Oregon Ducks, which started with their 2001 Fiesta Bowl blowout against Colorado and blossomed when I went to school there for three years, I’ve always respected the football team’s family-styled approach to coaching.  Starting with Rich Brooks, who coached the Ducks from 1977 to 1994, when he brought the Ducks to respectability and a Rose Bowl appearance before departing for the NFL, the Ducks always had, for the most part, a close knit family tree of coaching, as the ‘Next Man Up’ mantra reigned supreme.  But that era has ended today as the Oregon Ducks fired Mark Helfrich as their head coach after a disappointing 4-8 season.  Whether he was the right coach or whether the Ducks will replace him with someone better remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure, the Ducks are now just another program looking to win.  So what happened?</p>

  	<span class="date">November 26, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">It's officially rivalry week, where the Civil War and the Battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe is in full effect, along with a slew of other important games, including Michigan-Ohio State, Colorado-Utah and Alabama-Auburn.  If you're not ready for college football this week, then you shouldn't be watching football at all.  Conference champion bids on the line today in an exciting week for college football.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 19, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">The season's almost over, and there's no margin for error when it comes to finishing the season strong and ending the year on a positive note.  Oregon's not going to make a bowl, but they have two games left to try to pick up the pieces and finish the year on a positive note.  For Mark Helfrich, that could make the difference between remaining as head coach or not.  For the Golden Gophers, seven wins is not enough, eight would be better.  And the playoff race is down to the final stretch, and those who lose will face elimination.</p>

  	<span class="date">November 12, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">It's survival week in Week 11 for the Oregon Ducks, who played against Stanford to have one last shot at turning around their season and making a bowl game, which seemed like a forgone conclusion at the beginning of the season.  For Minnesota, it's the start of Minnesota's true challenges to determine their worth in the Big Ten West, heading to Nebraska to see if they still have an outside shot of winning the West.  How well would this turn out for each team?  How would the playoff chase take shape, in what turned out to be a crazy Playoff Saturday.</p>

  <h1>Thank You Intolerant Republicans for Ruining our Country</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 9, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Thank you Intolerant Republicans for ruining the country I used to think was fair and open minded.  Thanks to your extreme intolerance, you all have turned our country into a cesspool of fear, hate and bigotry.  Anyone with a differing view from you Intolerant Republicans is deemed problematic, awful and un-American.  Now that America has voted Dictator Donald Trump as President, I no longer feel safe or welcomed by the Federal Government.  As such, this will be my last political post, which is fine because Dictator Trump has completely ruined the country as we know it.  I am done with believing the Government will ever work for all Americans.  Extremism is the problem, not the solution, and anyone who thinks this type of change is good for us is biased and ignorant.</p>

I really hate USC, and I make it no secret, but you can read all about that <a href='http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2015/11/21/usc-my-anti-christ'>here</a>.  But there are more important things than bashing all things USC.  The Gophers played Purdue and with the official playoff rankings out, the chase really begins.</p>
