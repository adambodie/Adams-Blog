  <h1>One week in the Lakers Season - The 2016 Edition</h1>

  <p class="author">

  <p class="intro">Last year, I wrote about the Lakers season one week into the year, with much chagrin, as the Lakers took a while to win.  This season is a completely different story.  Would I call them a playoff team at this point?  Of course not, but there's a much different vibe this year.</p>

  <p class="intro">Week Nine featured two decent matchups on my end.  For the Gophers, it was the week to clinch bowl eligibility.  For Oregon, it was another week to end their hideous skid.  How did Week Nine play out?  Read here for my thoughts.</p>

  <p class="intro">Today marks the one year anniversary to my launch of Adam’s Blog.  It's come a long way from its humble roots, going through my major redesign in April.  So to honor my blog, here's a brief history of my blog and how I wound up getting here, along with some of my favorite posts.</p>

  	<span class="date">October 24, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Tomorrow is the beginning of the 2016-2017 NBA Season.  For me, I will have to adjust to life without Kobe.  Who should be my favorite player?  Should I even have a favorite player?  How will the brand new Lakers look.  Who's going to win the NBA Championship this year?  How will Kevin Durant adjust to being the villain in Golden State.  Here are my thoughts.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Eight Thoughts</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 22, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Eight is unofficially Homecoming Week.  For Minnesota, it's their official Homecoming game against Rutgers, their first matchup ever.  For Oregon, it's a painful reminder of how far they've truly fallen against another high powered offensive team in Cal.  That game was played yesterday.  As we reach Week 8, a closer picture starts for determining the four playoff teams.  I'll talk more about that later.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Seven Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 15, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Seven for me is Strange Week.  The Minnesota Golden Gophers make their way to Maryland to play them for the first time since they joined the Big Ten in 2014.  I'm still not used to them and Rutgers being part of the Big Ten.  Maryland should've remained in the ACC and Rutgers looks like complete crap.  Market aside, the Big Ten should've stopped with Nebraska.  But nonetheless, it's the game against the Terrapins.  As for the Ducks, they stand to have their best defensive performance of the season, as they have the week off.  As for the rest of the week, it seems kind of bland, with the exception of Alabama-Tennessee and Ohio State-Wisconsin.</p>

  <h1>Why I Should Be The Next Starting Quarterback of the Cleveland Browns</h1>

  <p class="intro">Tim Couch, Ty Detmer, Doug Pederson, Spergon Wynn, Kelly Holcomb, Jeff Garcia, Luke McCown, Trent Dilfer, Charlie Frye, Derek Anderson, Brady Quinn, Ken Dorsey, Bruce Gradkowski, Colt McCoy, Jake Delhomme, Seneca Wallace, Brandon Weeden, Thad Lewis, Jason Campbell, Brian Hoyer, Johnny Manziel, Connor Shaw, Josh McCown, Austin Davis, Robert Griffin III and Cody Kessler.	A list this long would be perfect to describe a proud NFL franchise's Hall of Famers, but no, this is the list of starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns since their franchise was reborn in 1998.  Clearly, the Cleveland Browns are cursed with Quarterbacks.  They're looking for the wrong qualities. Here are the reasons I should be the next starting quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.</p>

  <h1>So He Finally Used the A-Word</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">

  	<span class="date">October 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">It took sixteen months, but the Idiot finally used the A-word he never likes to use: <strong>APOLOGIZE</strong>.  What did it take for him to apologize?  A video mic drop recording of him saying some incredibly vulgar things about women, essentially bragging about hitting on a married woman and getting away with groping women because he’s a star.  He called it 'locker room banter,' I call it 'words a sexual predator would say.'  Now that he's used the A-word, he can now apologize to everyone he’s offended in his life.  Here's an partial list of everyone owed an apology.  He's offended so many people it's hard to keep track.</p>

  	<span class="date">October 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Six for me is Rivalry Week Part 1.  Minnesota hosted Iowa for the Floyd of Rosedale and Oregon hosted Washington, winning twelve in a row against them but looking far worse now than they have at ay time in those twelve years.  As for the the rest of the games, another entertaining variety of match-ups.</p>

  <h1>Sorry Norf Norf Lady</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 6, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Recently, I read about a viral video of a Christian woman, a mother of four, who blogged her video reaction upon listening to a rap song she heard on the radio, rapping the song line by line and getting upset over the lyrics.  The song in question, Norf Norf, by Vince Staples, is a typical example of a gangsta rap song.  Not surprisingly, the woman was quite offended that this song would appear on the radio, proclaiming the songs of the old days are better for kids.  Not surprisingly, that is simply not true, and there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.</p>
