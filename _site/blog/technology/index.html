 <h1>Tech Giants - The Real Viruses</h1>
<div class="row">

        <p class="intro">On Wednesday, my sister Jenn complained to me that her laptop with Windows 7 automatically updated to Windows 10, without giving her a choice. It made her angry, she refused to set it up for hours, and after a day of using it, Jenn lost internet
            access completely. Not surprisingly, Jenn was pissed by the whole endeavor, in an extremely grumpy mood that not even myself could snap her out of. Thankfully, Jenn found a way to revert her laptop to Windows 7 thanks to the wonders of instant
            data via the internet, and getting her Windows 7 back, Jenn was happy again as she should be. But it's the principle that matters: Tech companies shouldn't be allowed to force programs onto your computers. It goes against the very fiber of
            the American consumer industry, like a virus out to harm your computer.</p>

        <p class="intro">Anyone who used to watch Chappelle's Show back in the day surely remembers the skit, 'When Keeping it Real Goes Wrong,' as Dave Chappelle's comically showed skits of so-called thugs and gangstas in instances when it's not the best idea to 'keep
            it real.' But that was 2003, now in the days of social media, viral videos and tweets, it often shows that way too many people 'keep it real' when they shouldn't. A sad but unfortunate side effect of stupidity.</p>

        <p class="intro">Learning new ways to make blog posts or any developing tools in general is something I have always enjoyed. It's something encouraged by IBM, the parent company I work for. With that said, I am revamping my blog post as its own entity, rather
            than part of the Express framework I'm using for Bodie Web Design.</p>

 <h1>Don't Be Stupid on the Internet</h1>

        <p class="intro">Last night was the first round of the NFL Draft, a time for the best ranked prospects to join the NFL, a joyous time for those to hear their name called. Yet in this day and age, being stupid sells, and being stupid on the Internet never goes
            away no matter how hard you try. That's why all the buzz today is around Laremy Tunsil, a highly ranked offensive tackle who ended up falling to the 13th pick to the Miami Dolphins, as someone allegedly hacked into his Twitter account and
            posted a video of him smoking a bong through a gas mask earlier in the day.</p>

        <p class="intro">Back in December, a horrific attack occurred in San Bernardino from a husband and wife who supported ISIS. They were killed in a shootout, but yet another battle has raged. The FBI wants all the information on Syed Farook’s iPhone, but as it was
            encrypted with a password, they can’t get into it, for Apple’s security features erases the phone's data after 10 failed password attempts. Despite a Federal judge demanding Apple create a way to hack into the phone, Apple refuses to do so,
            believing everyone’s iPhone is at risk by creating such a back-door. Should Apple be forced to comply? Or is it better not to play with fire?</p>

            could make this web page too. So with those comments, here is how I made Bodie Web Design 2 and how you could too.</p>

        <p class="intro">Welcome to Bodie Web Design 2.0, the Express Edition. As you will see on my web page, I have updated my initial version of Bodie Web Design by using Express as a web framework. So why use Express (or any web framework) instead of just plain HTML,
            CSS &amp; JavaScript. The answer is simple: It's easier (if you know how to use it).</p>
