<p> On Wednesday, my sister Jenn complained to me that her laptop with Windows 7 automatically updated to Windows 10, without giving her a choice.  It made her angry, she refused to set it up for hours, and after a day of using it, Jenn lost internet access completely.  Not surprisingly, Jenn was pissed by the whole endeavor, in an extremely grumpy mood that not even myself could snap her out of.  Thankfully, Jenn found a way to revert her laptop to Windows 7 thanks to the wonders of instant data via the internet, and getting her Windows 7 back, Jenn was happy again as she should be.  But it's the principle that matters: Tech companies shouldn't be allowed to force programs onto your computers.  It goes against the very fiber of the American consumer industry, like a virus out to harm your computer.</p>

		<h4>I call Screen of Death on Microsoft</h4>
</div>
	<p>I recently bought a new laptop a few weeks ago running Windows 10, and I enjoy it.  A better OS than Windows 8, which was despised by most people, trying too hard to move to the tablet based technology without weaning people off of the classic laptop/desktop setting of Windows 7.  Windows 10 is a good mix of this.  But despite Microsoft's intent, they can't force programs onto a user's computer.  Some people enjoy Windows 7 and aren't ready to move on to Windows 10.  People should be able to upgrade as they see fit.  For me, I still use Microsoft Office 97, even though I know Microsoft Office 2010 is better, I just don't want to pay for it.  And I still use my copy of Adobe Photoshop 7.0 that I received from someone whom I consider to be the worst human being I've ever met, but I'm capable of making my own choices.  They still work for me, so why should I fork out money for something new.  Microsoft and Adobe shouldn't force me without choice to install a program without my input, especially when money is involved.</p>
	<p>Plenty of people make programs that have adverse affects on their computers, they call them viruses.  There's little difference between forcing someone to update to Windows 10 when they're in the middle of a big project and a virus that steals your information.  No matter who created the software, unwanted software is a virus.  It can have unintended consequences no matter the source of said virus and regardless of the intent.  Yet the tech giants insist that they have the ability to trick people into downloading their unwanted programs, sometimes without the option of saying no.</p>

		<h4>I'm not going to take a Chance on Apple Music (no pun intended)</h4>
</div>
	<p>Back in 2014, myself and millions upon millions of iTunes users found themselves with songs from a new U2 album, Songs of Innocence, that I neither asked for or knew existed.  Like many of those users, I don't like U2, never wanted nor never asked for a crappy U2 album.  You wouldn't want anyone to give you a program you don't want, why would you want Apple to download an album onto your iTunes without your permission.  Some less tech-savvy people may not be aware of how to remove said programs (or songs) and it's unfair to the consumer who doesn't want your crappy program without the option of saying ‘No'.  If I want to buy the crappy U2 album, it's my choice, not Apple's.  Just like it's not my choice, nor anyone's to have a Trojan horse installed onto my computer.<p>

	<p>So please Microsoft, while we are aware you want everyone to use Windows 10, it's not realistic that everyone will want it.  People like Windows 7 and their desktops/laptops may be better suitable with it than Windows 10.  This is especially true when in the middle of a big problem.  And to Apple, I wouldn't listen to U2's Songs of Innocence album even if Apple put a gun to my head forcing me to listen to it.  I have a right to choose. And while we're talking about Apple, stop trying to trick people into your Apple Music streaming service.  Streaming music for a fee each month is a stupid idea.  It works with movie streaming like Netflix since movies require a screen to watch, but music can be enjoyed everywhere and people have the right to listen to their music without a valid internet connection.  It's especially stupid when rappers like Chance the Rapper claim his new mixtape Coloring Book is free but require you to pay a subscription fee each month to listen to it without any other options to listen to it.  #LAME!</p>
