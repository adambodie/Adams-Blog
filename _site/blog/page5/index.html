  <h1>Star Wars - The Whole Shebang So Far</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">August 23, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">For the past seven weekends, I have been watching all the main Star Wars films, from the classic trilogy to the newer prequels, some of which I hadn't seen before, all in Episode order, culminating in the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens.  As a kid, I enjoyed the classic Star Wars films, and saw Episode I, which I didn't care for, effectively turning me off of Episode II and III.  Older and wiser, and with a new movie out, I owed it to myself to see the entire series so far from beginning to current.  Without giving away any major plot spoilers that aren't clearly well-known: ("I am your Father," anyone?), here are my thoughts on all seven films.</p>

  <h1>XXL Freshmen 2016 - My Thoughts</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">August 22, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Every year, XXL magazine, a popular hip-hop magazine, releases its annual 'Freshmen Edition,' highlighting young and promising MCs that XXL believes will become big stars in the game.  Like any 'draft,' some become big stars while others never pan out.  I used to get really excited over these lists, but it peaked in 2010, with dope artists like Freddie Gibbs, J. Cole, Wiz Khalifa, Big Sean, Nipsey Hu$$le and Jay Rock still holding some star power in their own and special way.  Nowadays, the list is a reminder of how much of a decline popular hip-hop is.  I wanted to write this when the list first came out in June, but held off to give myself some time to listen to some of these rappers, none of whom were MC's I loved, and only a few I even had songs from.  So who amongst the 2016 list has any credibility?  Here are my thoughts, starting from top left of their cover.</p>

  <h1>Top 11 Road Trips for 111,111 Miles</h1>

  <p class="intro">Today I reached 111,111 miles on my lovely Barracuda, my first and so far only car that I've had for a little over 11 years.  It seemed like just yesterday that I got my first car, as Dad drove me back home from Eugene to spend the weekend at home, only to see a nice 2005 silver Honda Accord DX sitting in the driveway with a big bow on it.  Little did I know that the car was there waiting for me to enjoy it.  For those who don't know the story of its name, the first song I played in the car was Heart's hit song, Barracuda. I've had many wonderful trips with my Barracuda, from the Oregon Coast to Memphis, from Seattle to Chicagoland, 22 states in all.  I've had a lifetime of adventures with Barracuda, from the highs to the lows (though never more than a little scratch).  In honor of my wonderful times on the road, here is a countdown of my Top 11 Road Trips for 111,111 miles.</p>

  <h1>Making A Murderer - Brendan Dassey's Redemption</h1>

  <p class="author">

  <p class="intro">When I watched Netflix's <a href='http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/entertainment/2016/01/19/making-a-murderer-my-thoughts-on-the-steven-avery-case'>Making a Murderer</a> early in January, the biggest puzzling thing about that case was that Steven Avery's nephew Brendan Dassey was convicted of anything at all, much less for the murder of Teresa Halbach based on a clearly coerced confession.  As news hit yesterday that a Federal judge in Milwaukee agreed, overturning the conviction, I can't help but feel relieved that Dassey got some redemption.</p>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">August 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Three months from today, on November 8th, the country I call home, the United States of America, will elect a new President. Our country's future is at stake.  On one hand is Hillary Clinton, Former First Lady, Senator of New York and Secretary of State.  On the other hand is Donald Trump, who can simply be described as a Tyrannical Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig.  I am sick and tired of hearing about this fool.  Everything he says is stupid, childish and filled with hate.  There are a plethora of reasons not to vote for this degenerate, I've managed to find one-hundred reasons, but the reasons don't stop there.  He has zero qualities of a worthy President and even less qualities of a proud American. This is why I am taking a pledge to no longer refer to him by his name and pledge to start calling him simply as The Idiot.</p>

  <h1>RNC vs. DNC - Two Different Worlds</h1>

  <p class="intro">The Republican and Democrat National Conventions have come and gone, officially ending the Primaries.  Seeing bits of each, I can safely say one thing: the two Parties are from two different worlds. One filled with anger and hate, the other filled with love and passion.  So which one better reflects us as a nation?  Here are my thoughts on each convention and my allegiance going forward.</p>

  <h1>Donald Trump, Vice President of Russia?</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">July 27, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Last week, just before the Democratic National Convention started, hackers released emails from the DNC pertaining to their head’s plans to push candidate Bernie Sanders out of the race.  The hacks were deemed by U.S. officials as likely the work of the Russians, perhaps in an attempt to sway the election towards Republican Donald Trump.  Now, Donald Trump himself has asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them.  Clearly, Donald Trump prefers Russia over Democrats in the United States.  A man who has repeatedly praised Russia President Vladimir Putin as a great leader and capable of ‘getting stuff done,’ one question remains.  Is Donald Trump working to become President of the United States or the Vice President of Russia?</p>

  <p class="intro">For the past two weeks, I've heard the most bizarre stories, all relating to the new super-viral video game that has seemingly taken over the world, Pokemon Go.  Pokemon first hit the scene 20 years ago, but this game allows people to try to 'catch-em all' based on real-world locations, getting people out and about just to catch Pokemon on their game.  It's led to some bizarre stories; people catching criminals, getting stabbed by others, finding dead bodies, guns, etc., getting in car accidents, taking up police parking, fire parking, and other bizarre warnings all over Pokemon Go.  I played the original Pokemon games when I was a teenager, but now we're seeing adults playing the game; it's pure madness, all these ridiculous real-life events happening based solely on this game.  Imagine what else this game can lead to.  Here's a list of five things I wish this game could find.</p>

  <p class="intro">When I was young, I only saw beer in black and white.  Obviously, I didn't drink beer, but my Mom occasionally drank beer, mainly when we went to the Oak Hills Brewpub, where she ordered the dark beers, the Porters and Stouts.  From then, I considered good beers to be dark, while crap beers like Bud, Miller and Coors as the bad beers.  It wasn't until I was 26 that I decided to try beer for the first time, as McMenamins on Allen and Murray. I had a sampler of dark and light beers, mainly interested in the Black Rabbit Porter and Terminator Stout.  From then on, I found myself trying all styles of beers, dark and light, where I learned there's more than just BMC crap (Bud-Miller-Coors for the uninformed).</p>

  <h1>Enough is Enough</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">July 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Enough is enough.  For so long, our country has turned a blind eye on racism, proclaiming that it's not a big deal like it used to be, just because of Civil Rights and the elimination of Jim Crow laws.  But recent events, particularly the deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas have shown just how horrific racism in the United States really is.  Is there a coincidence that this is happening now at this current time?  Of course not.  This is a by-product of the anger and race baiting politics that Donald Trump has shoved down America's throats.</p>
