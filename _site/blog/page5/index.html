  <h1>Donald The Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig</h1>

  <p class="intro">In an election where Donald Trump has seemingly offended just about everyone that's not an old white Christian, it was only inevitable that Donald Trump would be accused of Anti-Semitism.  With all the Islamophobia Donald Trump keeps spreading, it's hard to forget that the Jews have historically been hated on by the majority of non-Jews.  Recently, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with money in the background and a Star of David symbol proclaiming  'Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.'  Trump took it down two hours later and replaced it with a circle replacing the Jewish Star.  Does this make Donald Trump Anti-Semitic or just plain stupid.  Here are my thoughts on Trump's history of Anti-Semitism.</p>

  <p class="intro">We've reached the end of June, which essentially means we're halfway through the year.  I've had a successful year so far, and I'm aiming to continue that with an even better second half of the year.  So here's to me, but also to those who have supported me along the way, because I wouldn't be the person I am without the loving support of my family and friends.</p>

  <p class="intro">I wasn't going to say anything about the global phenomenon known stupidly as 'Brexit,' it doesn't really affect me personally since I don't live in the United Kingdom.  It's really an issue out of my league.  But after seeing the English soccer team lose an epic upset to Iceland in Euro 2016, I've decided to say a few words based solely so I can use the following joke: England just brexited Euro 2016.  The timing couldn't be any better.  Here are my thoughts on Brexit.</p>

  <h1>NBA Draft - The Future is Now</h1>

  <p class="intro"><strong>4:32 pm - </strong>Tonight is the 2016 NBA Draft, where the young stars join their new teams.  For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like they did last year with D'Angelo Russell.  While Russell wasn't an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype.  Who will the Lakers take with the number 2 picks.  All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be announced in 10 minutes.</p>

  <h1>The Big Short vs. Spotlight - Which Movie was better</h1>

  <p class="intro">I was asked to compare two recent movies and Oscar nominated and winning movies from this years Academy Awards.  The challenger on the left is The Big Short, which won Best Adapted Screenplay.  The champion on the right is Spotlight, which won Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.  So which movie did I think was better?  Here are my thoughts.</p>

  <h1>Three Little Words</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">June 12, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">I woke up Sunday morning, as I usually do, looking at my iPhone to check the news.  Like millions of others who woke up today, I was disgusted and saddened to hear that 49 people had been killed in a terrorist attack at an Orlando gay nightclub, Pulse.  Like most, I despise terrorism and hate whenever it occurs.  But stopping terrorism here in the United States and the world requires our nation and our allies to come together.  But instead, we have our Republican congressmen and wannabe congressmen furthering dividing us and claiming defeating Terrorism is as easy as saying three little words...</p>

  <h1>Rape - A Nasty Side Effect of Society's Mistreatment of Women</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">June 9, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Much buzz on the news is about a rapist name Brock Turner, a former Stanford swimmer who raped an unconscious woman and received just six months in prison for it, despite being convicted of three felony sexual assault charges.  Though the defendant claims he understands what he did was wrong, he has managed to show how little responsibility he has actually taken for his crimes, feeling like he is the victim just as much as the woman he raped. Cases like this show just how little regard some men have for women in general and how that, more than anything, leads to rape.</p>

  <h1>Muhammad Ali, the Greatest</h1>

  	<span class="date">June 6, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On Friday night, late in the evening, I found out that Muhammad Ali, the legendary boxer, had passed away at the age of 74.  Though I'm not a boxing fan and I don't know any boxing fans, there was always one boxer that everyone knew about, Mr. Muhammad Ali.  Though some would argue that Mike Tyson is equally famous, he was known for the wrong reasons.  But Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest, as he frequently claimed, but he was the most important athlete of the 20th Century in any sport.</p>

  <h1>Tech Giants - The Real Viruses</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">June 3, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On Wednesday, my sister Jenn complained to me that her laptop with Windows 7 automatically updated to Windows 10, without giving her a choice.  It made her angry, she refused to set it up for hours, and after a day of using it, Jenn lost internet access completely.  Not surprisingly, Jenn was pissed by the whole endeavor, in an extremely grumpy mood that not even myself could snap her out of.  Thankfully, Jenn found a way to revert her laptop to Windows 7 thanks to the wonders of instant data via the internet, and getting her Windows 7 back, Jenn was happy again as she should be.  But it's the principle that matters: Tech companies shouldn't be allowed to force programs onto your computers.  It goes against the very fiber of the American consumer industry, like a virus out to harm your computer.</p>

  <h1>NBA Finals Preview</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">June 2, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">The NBA Finals have arrived, featuring as I expected, a rematch of last year's Finals, Golden State vs. Cleveland.  Last year, Cleveland, despite missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, played their hardest, gave Golden State a legitimate scare before Golden State was able to win their first championship in 40 years.  Things have changed slightly this year, with the aforementioned Irving and Love healthy this time around, while Golden State, with not much change, finished with an NBA record 73 wins in the regular season.  So who wins the rematch?  Here are my thoughts.</p>
