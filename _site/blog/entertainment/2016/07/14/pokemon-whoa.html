		<h4>Do the right thing...say No to Pokemon Go</h4>
</div>
<p> For the past two weeks, I've heard the most bizarre stories, all relating to the new super-viral video game that has seemingly taken over the world, Pokemon Go.  Pokemon first hit the scene 20 years ago, but this game allows people to try to 'catch-em all' based on real-world locations, getting people out and about just to catch Pokemon on their game.  It's led to some bizarre stories; people catching criminals, getting stabbed by others, finding dead bodies, guns, etc., getting in car accidents, taking up police parking, fire parking, and other bizarre warnings all over Pokemon Go.  I played the original Pokemon games when I was a teenager, but now we're seeing adults playing the game; it's pure madness, all these ridiculous real-life events happening based solely on this game.  Imagine what else this game can lead to.  Here's a list of five things I wish this game could find.</p>

<ol>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
	<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/db-cooper.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="D.B. Cooper" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Who's D.B. Cooper?  Maybe Pokemon can find him.</h4>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	<li>D.B. Cooper: The FBI just a few days ago officially stopped investigating the infamous D.B. Cooper case, a man who in 1971 hijacked a plane flying from Portland to Seattle, jumping out of the plane with $200,000 ransom.  No one has ever found him or any evidence he even survived the jump, but in 1980, an eight-year old boy found some of the ransom money washed up somewhere in southwest Washington near the town of Amboy.  Wouldn't it only be perfect for someone playing the game nearby to find additional money hidden in the ground, or perhaps, a body for the legendary D.B. Cooper.  Maybe some other additional evidence. </li>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
	<li> Missing children: Children are our future, and anyone who would want to hurt, kidnap or kill a child is scum.  Maybe some lucky Pokemon Go player searching for that rare Pokemon can find a missing child, whether dead or alive, at least to bring closure for their loved ones.  One particular child I want found is Kyron Horman, who disappeared June 4, 2010 after being 'picked up' from school for an alleged doctor's appointment by that 'step-mother,' whose name isn't worth repeating.  Wouldn't that be the dream.</li>
</div>

<div class="col-md-6">
	<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/kyron.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kyron Horman" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Missing children like Kyron Horman need to be found.</h4>
	</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6"> 
	<li>O.J. Simpson's Murder gloves: In 1994, the nation was shocked when O.J. Simpson's wife, Nicole Brown Simpson was murdered, allegedly by O.J. Simpson himself.  From the infamous White Bronco car chase down I-405 in Los Angeles to the Trial of the Century that found him Not Guilty, people all around have wondered if O.J. Simpson was guilty or not.  One of the key points of that trial was his gloves.  If only some random Pokemon Go player could find the gloves he wore when he probably killed Nicole Brown Simpson and friend Ron Goldman while looking for that rare Pokemon.  To this day, it's still the most likely scenario, as no alternate scenario has come forth, it's likely that O.J. was guilty all along.</li>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/oj-glove.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="O.J. Simpson" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Of course the glove didn't fit.</h4>
	</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
	<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/grants-pass.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Grants Pass" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>I got rich in Grants Pass...just kidding.  It was only $40.00</h4>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
	<li>Dropped Dolla Bill Y'all: If someone dropped some cash and no one was around, would you take it?  I'm not talking about thousands of dollars, more like $40.  That was the dilemma I faced when I visited Grants Pass, stopping for a picture of their Welcome sign.  I just happened to notice some loose twenties laying in the street.  Sure, if I saw someone actually drop it, that's different, but no one would identify the money as theirs, and if not me, someone else would.  So, I picked it up and went on with my day and my trip.  If only Pokemon Go could locate dropped dollar bills in the name of Pokemon, that would be sweet.  For the record, I don't condone stealing money.  Please don't.</li>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<li>A secret meeting where Donald Trump discusses his REAL thoughts: Trump lies about everything.  Moral integrity is a foreign word to him.  No one knows what he's actually thinking or what he'd actually do to the United States if elected President (my guess involves his favorite number, 11).  Wouldn't it be great for some Pokemon Go player looking for a Pokemon to stumble upon a secret meeting he's having admitting to his people what a crock of shit he really is.  One thing's for sure, Pokemon Go won't find any proof of Hillary Clinton's alleged Benghazi lies; they don't exist...</li>
	</div>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<div class="blog-pic">
			<img src="/img/mike-pence-donald-trump.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Donald Trump and Mike Pence" class="image block img-responsive" />
			<h4>I don't know what's more disturbing, the fact that anyone would actually want to be Donald Trump's Vice Presidential candidate, as Mike Pence agreed to, or Donald Trump's chin.  What's wrong with that thing?</h4>
