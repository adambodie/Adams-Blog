<p> For the past seven weekends, I have been watching all the main Star Wars films, from the classic trilogy to the newer prequels, some of which I hadn't seen before, all in Episode order, culminating in the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens.  As a kid, I enjoyed the classic Star Wars films, and saw Episode I, which I didn't care for, effectively turning me off of Episode II and III.  Older and wiser, and with a new movie out, I owed it to myself to see the entire series so far from beginning to current.  Without giving away any major plot spoilers that aren't clearly well-known: ("I am your Father," anyone?), here are my thoughts on all seven films.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/force.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The Force Awakens" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>The Force Awakens</h4>
</div>
<p>Episode I: The Phantom Menace - When I first saw The Phantom Menace years ago, I didn't care for it that much.  I enjoyed playing a racing game based on the movie on my Nintendo 64, which was also one of the best parts of the movie.  But the kid who played Anakin Skywalker was very annoying and Jar Jar Binks was a complete joke.  Seeing it now, I still agree with Anakin being annoying and Jar Jar being a joke.  It shouldn't be that surprising this is the worst movie of the bunch, as the beginning of the story is never the best.  Liam Neeson playing the Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn seems like a mismatch and Samuel L Jackson as Mace Windu didn't do much for me either.</p>
<p>Episode II: Attack of the Clones - I didn't have any desire to see Attack of the Clones (or Revenge of the Sith) until now, and seeing it for the first time, found the movie to be average and unremarkable.  There was nothing about this film that really stood out, and Anakin Skywalker, now an adult (played by Hayden Christensen) was poorly played.  Christensen comes off as a bit of a pompous ass, and did a poor job.  One bright spot was evil Sith Lord Count Dooku (played by Christopher Lee), along with his fight with Yoda.  Other than that, this film left a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith - Easily the best of the first three films, Revenge of the Sith showcases the end of Anakin Skywalker and the beginning of Darth Vader.  Though I personally found the transition to be too quick and brief, it was still thrilling to see the transition, despite the continued bad acting from Hayden Christensen.  Even better was seeing him and Obi-Wan Kenobi fight in the lava, leaving Vader scarred and the subsequent scene of being reconstructed as the classic Darth Vader.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/vader.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Darth Vader" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Who can forget the evil Darth Vader?</h4>
</div>
<p>Episode IV: A New Hope - The original Star Wars film is an obvious classic, the one that started the franchise and its popularity today.  I saw it plenty of times as a kid, seen it parodied from Spaceballs to Family Guy, and referenced in other TV shows and movies.  But having seen the prequels, now I know the complete story of Darth Vader’s past, along with Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Palpatine and the others.  It makes Vader slightly more sympathetic, but not right away.  Still, Vader is pure evil.  With classic characters from Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca being introduced, The New Hope is a classic.</p>
<p>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back - The Empire Strikes Back is the best movie of the series, showcasing the ruthlessness of Darth Vader even more, along with the many plot twists and turns.  Introducing characters like fan-favorite Boba Fett, Lando Calrissian, and Luke’s first interaction with Yoda make this the best of the bunch.  And how could anyone forget the scene when Darth Vader tells Luke that he is his father (Everyone knows that already)</p>
<p>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi - Return of the Jedi wasn't as good as the previous two films, but wraps up the story of Darth Vader nicely.  On the one hand, Jabba the Hutt, the most awesomely grotesque character in Star Wars (possibly the best character ever) appears mightily early in the film (he appeared in a re-release of the original movie, but I won't go into all the re release controversies).  Watching him is a delight.  But they also had the too-cute for their own good Ewoks, which were obviously meant to appeal to the kids.  The ending was good as Darth Vader finally broke free from the dark side to kill Emperor Palpatine to save Luke.  Seeing the prequels made this more understandable.  It was weird to see the re release with the ghost of Hayden Christensen-played Anakin Skywalker though.  He still sucks.</p>

		<h4>Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo when they were young</h4>
</div>
<p>Episode VII: The Force Awakens - All of this brings us to The Force Awakens, the beginning of the final trilogy of Star Wars, which was released last year to lots of fanfare.  I won't spoil any parts of the movie for those interested, but I enjoyed The Force Awakens.  Not as good as the classics but much better than the prequels, The Force Awakens manages to blend the classic characters with new and interesting characters.  New characters like the conscious-filled Finn, the strong and determined Ray and the villanous yet emotional Kylo Ren bring lots of complexity, while the little robot BB-8 is easily cute and lovable like R2-D2 before him.  On a side note, R.I.P. to Kenny Baker, the actor who played R2-D2 who recently passed away.  Classic characters like Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker are for the most part, what you would expect from the characters aged 30+ years.  Luke Skywalker looks much different than I expected, but that's all I will say about that.  The plot, which I won't go into too much, is also good, although I find the Supreme Leader Snoke to be kind of boring compared to Palpatine, despite his deft-defying appearance.</p>
<p>When it's all said and done, it's easy to see why Star Wars has managed to remain popular after all these years, and with a good start for the final trilogy, who knows what will happen with Episodes VIII (due to be released in 2017) and IX (due to be released in 2019).  There's plenty to like about Star Wars (and a few things to dislike, eh hem Jar Jar Binks) and there's no other series out there with the lasting appeal and grace of Star Wars (sorry, Lord of the Rings, I just couldn't get into the series when I watched it).  May the Force be with you!</p>
