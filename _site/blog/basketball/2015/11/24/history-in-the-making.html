<p>Tonight, the Lakers play the Golden State Warriors in a game with the potential of making history.  While the Lakers are used to setting records, tonight it's the Warriors, 15-0, looking for the most consecutive wins the start the season.  Let's be honest, the Lakers have no shot of winning in Golden State.  It's 20-7 as I type this sentence.  But watching the Warriors play, makes me wonder how things have changed drastically in the NBA.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">
	<img src="/img/warriors.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="One day, the Lakers will stop Steph Curry.  But not today." class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>One day, the Lakers will stop Steph Curry.  But not today.</h4>
</div>



<p>The Warriors play small ball, not focused on size.  While they deploy Andrew Bogut as their center, it's all about the guards and spread out forwards.  Steph Curry is simply put, the most dynamic offensive player around, maybe ever.  The way Curry shoots, dribbles, and attacks the lane with such smooth efficiency is almost scary to watch.  Klay Thompson, the shooting guard, serves as the perfect complement, able to shoot just as well, but with defensive capabilities as well.  Harrison Barnes is capable of putting up points at any given time.  The key difference to the team is perhaps, Draymond Green, the power forward who can not only pound it and get rebounds, but also shoots three pointers with some efficiency.  And how can you forget last year's Finals MVP Andre Iguadola off the bench as their defensive anchor.</p>

<p>Seeing the first quarter ending, with the Warriors up 30-11, it's clear the Lakers are nowhere near their talent.  How do the Lakers get there?  As the Lakers showed by selecting D'Angelo Russell over the big man Jahlil Okafor, guard play is taking over the league.  Gone are the days of the big man anchoring a team.  Also apparent is the Warriors excellent drafting.  Curry, Thompson, and Barnes were all lottery picks, and Draymond Green was a pure touch of gold as a second round selection.  The only free agent splash they made was Iguadola, who sacrificed everything by coming off the bench and reaping all the benefits of winning a Championship (and being Finals MVP, nonetheless).</p>

<p>The Lakers are working on this.  Russell, Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson were all draft picks (Clarkson was acquired in the second round last year in a trade for cash), who need time to grow.  Curry, Thompson and Barnes went through their bumps in the beginning.  Now look at them.  Then they can get a star free agent to come along.  Kobe is on his last limbs, and no one will come as a free agent to take over the reigns to play with him.  Why would they?  Gone are the days of players like Shaq coming for the LA glory, when the Lakers were mediocre before his arrival.  Players have more control and want the best chance at an NBA Title, not just sunshine.</p>

<p>So as I start to get bored watching this game, knowing the Lakers will likely lose by at least 20, if not 30, I offer the Lakers the best advice I can get.  Develop young players: D'Angelo Russell looks better than he did the last time I watched him.  So do Clarkson and Randle.  Make some great draft picks, which can be difficult since the draft is a crap shoot (after all, who knew Kristaps Porzingis would make a good impact for the NY Knicks).  Get high draft picks, since the Lakers need a top three pick to keep it this year (apparently, LSU has a freshman named Ben Simmons who's supposed to be the next big thing, we'll see).  And finally, take your lumps, especially the young players, because it will be a while for the Lakers can become successful again.  So as its 45-28 Warriors, I'll say adieu for tonight, comment on how ridiculously complex the back of their jerseys are (I like the front, quite classy, but the cable car backs seem like overkill, though I would prefer their old school Run-TMC era jerseys) and suggest that my Grandpa and step-Grandma always seem more excited to see Klay Thompson than me (so he used to live down the street, I met him once as a kid, whoopee, but Mychal Thompson was an all-time great at the University of Minnesota, so there's that).  Good night! [Editors Note: The final score was 111-77 Golden State.  They won by 34, go figure]</p>
