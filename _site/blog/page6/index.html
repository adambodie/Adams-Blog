  <h1>Ted Cruz - The Definition of Pathetic</h1>

  <p class="intro">I've seen and read about many bad politicians in my lifetime.  Former Senator Trent Lott, who in 2002 claimed we’d be better off had we voted for racist Senator Strom Thurmond is one.  Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich attempts to sell Obama’s Senate seat and other criminal activities is another.  Former Florida Congressman Mark Foley and his sexually explicit texts to teenage boys was also disturbing, along with the many congressmen and politicians who’ve cheated on their spouses, i.e. Newt Gingrich, Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner.  But despite all those with questionable ethics, criminal policies and downright slanderous misgivings, no politician has or ever will be more pathetic, manipulative, uncooperative or untrustworthy than Senator Ted Cruz.</p>

  <p class="intro">Last night was the first round of the NFL Draft, a time for the best ranked prospects to join the NFL, a joyous time for those to hear their name called. Yet in this day and age, being stupid sells, and being stupid on the Internet never goes away no matter how hard you try. That's why all the buzz today is around Laremy Tunsil, a highly ranked offensive tackle who ended up falling to the 13th pick to the Miami Dolphins, as someone allegedly hacked into his Twitter account and posted a video of him smoking a bong through a gas mask earlier in the day.</p>

  <h1>The Curse of Donald Sterling Lives</h1>

  <p class="intro">Growing up, I didn't think much of the Los Angeles Clippers. Why should I have? They were a complete joke, a bumbling group of losers who couldn't win squat, couldn't put together a decent roster and worst of all had an incompetent owner who wouldn't spend any money to keep what little talent they had. It wasn't until the other owners handed them Chris Paul in an effort to keep him from being traded to the Laker did the Clippers finally start to look like a real basketball team. But as the Lakers sunk to the floor, have the Clippers overtaken them? Not even close. No matter how talented the Clippers are, they’ll always be in second place, and incapable of winning the title. Whether they like it or not, they are defined by their disgraceful former owner Donald Sterling.</p>

  <p class="intro">As we're weeks away from Oregon’s Primary election, May 17th, it has become clear that for the first time in ages, Oregonians everywhere will actually have a say for the primaries. As one of the last states, the candidate has typically been decided before April, but this year we’re in a dead heat on both sides of the puzzle. With Kentucky the only other state with their primary the same day, Oregon at last will get the attention it needs for determining each party's nominee for President.</p>

  <h1>The Day the Music Died Part 3</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">April 21, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">When people refer to “The Day the Music Died,” they are referring to the tragic death of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper when they perished in a plane crash outside of Clear Lake, Iowa on February 3, 1959. Yet years later, we’ve lost many musicians with a far bigger influence. With apologies to Elvis Presley, John Lennon, everyone in the “27 Club” (Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and more recently, Amy Winehouse), we’ve seen two deaths in the music world truly crushing since that day. The second was of course, Michael Jackson’s tragic death on June 25, 2009, and the third was today, as Prince passed away.</p>

  <p class="intro">It’s true what they say, Kobe always know how to put on a show. The second half of his final game was no exception. As I watched Kobe take shot after shot after shot, I wondered if he was really trying to reach 50 points. The announcers mentioned that could be the case in the first quarter. I would have been happy with 40 points. The plan was to sit Kobe the first half of the fourth quarter. That didn’t happen. Suddenly, the race to 50 was on.</p>

  <h1>The Hall of Fame will never be the same, thanks Shaq</h1>

  <p class="intro">When it comes to the NBA, there are two types of players who dominate; players with amazing skills and smarts, and players with an unmatched physical advantage, players I like to call ‘a physical freak of nature.’ While players like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant will come and go, the physical freaks are rarer, and though not all players in the category are elite, the ones who do are able to use their advantageous attributes effectively and skillfully. Today, it comes as no surprise that Shaquille O’Neal, a man who needs no introduction, was selected to join the Basketball Hall of Fame. There was never a player like Shaq when he was playing, and with the changing of the style of play in professional basketball, there will probably never be a player as dominant and larger-than-life as Shaq, both physically and verbally.</p>

  <h1>Never Use a Public Restroom in North Carolina</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">March 29, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Our country has numerous issues that need to be resolved, whether it’s the economy, security or health related issues. Yet some people in North Carolina have apparently found something far more drastic and destructive to our lives; bathrooms, and who can and can’t enter them. To hear North Carolinians talk, it’s no longer safe to go into a restroom without wondering who might sneak up from behind and attack you. You might as well not use public restrooms at all in the state of North Carolina, because suddenly, there has been an increase of men going into women’s restrooms and attacking them, except for the fact, of course, that men aren’t illegally going into women’s restrooms and they’re definitely not attacking them. So why all the hubbub over restrooms?</p>

  <h1>NCAA Tournament From 68 down to the Final Four</h1>

  <p class="intro">This year’s March Madness has truly personified to term Madness, to say the least. My bracket was shot early on, as Michigan State, my pick to win it all, got shocked by Middle Tennessee State, in what was statistically one of the biggest upsets ever. High seeds including West Virginia (3), California (4) and multiple 5 seeds, Purdue and Baylor were upset as well. My upset picks didn’t pan out, except for Gonzaga over Seton Hall and VCU over Oregon State, but not nearly as impressive as Middle Tennessee State, Little Rock, Yale, Stephen F. Austin and Hawaii winning. Here are my thoughts on the Tournament as a whole.</p>
