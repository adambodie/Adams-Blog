<p>As a Minnesota Vikings fan, I watched the 2014 NFL Draft hoping for two things. One was that the Vikings would take a quarterback that would be their franchise quarterback, and the other was that they wouldn't wind up with Heisman winning Quarterback Johnny Manziel. The Vikings needed a quarterback, but Johnny Manziel was not only a terrible fit for the Vikings, but he was and is to this day, a party boy who wants to be a celebrity with little focus on the game.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>Enjoy the money while you can...</h4>
</div>

<p>As the draft started, there were a few teams that really needed quarterbacks; Jacksonville, Cleveland, Oakland and of course, Minnesota.  Jacksonville, with the third pick, took Blake Bortles to be their future quarterback.  I expected that all along.  Of the remaining teams, I expected Cleveland to take him.  As the first round proceeded and Johnny still on the board, I wondered who would be stupid enough to take him.  Suddenly, the 22nd pick rolled around and the Philadelphia Eagles, eager to trade down, had two teams interested in acquiring the pick, Cleveland and Minnesota; two teams that needed a quarterback.  It wasn't known until after the draft that Minnesota made an offer, but Cleveland had the stronger offer and acquired the pick, drafting Manziel, who called Cleveland's GM and told him 'let's wreck this league together.'  And just like that, Minnesota avoided the plague of Johnny Manziel, who ended up with the team I thought would take him all along, the stupidest franchise in the NFL.</p>

<p>All along I knew that Johnny Manziel would be nothing more than a party boy celebrity and a huge distraction for a team that hasn't had any direction since the franchise was reborn in 1999.  He acted cocky in college, taunting opponents, flashing the 'money sign,' partying at school, drinking champagne with his Mom (apparently legal in Texas for a minor), and of course, the alleged improper benefits.  Not only did this behavior continue, some of it got even worse as time progressed.</p>

<p>Flash forward to his rookie season.  Before the season even started, Manziel appeared in many photos and videos partying and drinking.  Just what you'd expect from a wannabe celebrity.  He would always say the right things, yet he never did what he actually said.  Study the playbook?  He said he would, but yet admitted he didn't spend much time studying the playbook.  Be prepared as a backup?  He said he was but yet his interests were elsewhere and wasn't ready to take the starting job from an otherwise average Brian Hoyer.  Partying with the Drake's of the world, throwing parties after being sidelined for the rest of the season with an injury and getting pissed drunk when he was supposed to be preparing with the team, these were the things Johnny Manziel was most interested in.  By the time he actually got to play a game, late in the season, he was embarrassed and produced very little offense, all while getting mocked by his opponents for his obnoxious “money sign.”  He only started two games, getting injured in the second one, and yet after his injury, he threw a party and got wasted when he was supposed to report to team activities.  Everything I saw in Johnny Manziel in college ended up getting worse in the NFL, and that's solely his personal life.  His performance on the field was terrible.  He wasn't prepared to play, only to party.</p>

	<h4>Partying: More at ease holding up wads of cash</h4>
</div>

<p>After his rookie season, Johnny Manziel went to rehab 'to improve on his life.'  Somehow, I get the feeling that Johnny Manziel has a drinking problem.  Many of his bad choices have involved alcohol, yet he doesn't seem willing to accept it's a problem, hiding behind the 'improve my life' blanket.  He spent ten weeks in rehab,  and not surprisingly it didn't help all that much.  Second season around, Johnny Manziel got more playing time, and he did play somewhat decent at times, but all the stories anyone wanted to talk about were his secret trips to Vegas that he promised his coaches he wouldn't go on, getting pulled over by the police for domestic incidents, and not checking in with the team for required concussion tests (he was partying, no surprise), not to mention lying to his coaches about these distractions.</p>

<p>With all of this said, it's little surprise that Cleveland finally reached its limit, announcing their intent to release him next month (when they won't take a salary hit for his contract).  With new coach Hue Jackson and a new staff starting over for the umpteenth time, this was the time to get rid of him.  So as to no surprise to me, Johnny Manziel's career in Cleveland ended up exactly as I thought, little on-the-field production with a lot of bad behavior and controversy.  My gut feeling tells me that Manziel wanted out of Cleveland and acted up on purpose, but his type of behavior could lead to little interest and being completely out of the league in a few years (if not earlier), rendering him a complete bust.</p>

<p>Thankfully, my Vikings did not have to deal with this.  They acquired the last pick of the first round and took quarterback Teddy Bridgewater out of Louisville, who not only has proven to be a capable quarterback, but has done so being a model citizen.  Winning the NFC North and being in the playoffs is a far better way to end the season than hearing your 'future' quarterback is drunk off his ass.</p>

<p>Update: When dealing with athletes who do stupid things, it's often easy to make fun of them for acting stupid.  Johnny Manziel is no exception; in fact, he probably gets more flak than most athletes with his obnoxious attitude.  However, certain actions arise and suddenly, you feel sorry for them, and suddenly, the story gets sad.  As reports appeared that Manziel repeatedly smacked his now ex-girlfriend, threatened to kill her and himself, along with his father speaking to the media today (February 5, 2016) trying to get Manziel into rehab, fearing he won't reach his next birthday, now this story is sad.  So in conclusion, Manziel needs to focus on his life, because until he does, his NFL career is over, end of story.</p>
