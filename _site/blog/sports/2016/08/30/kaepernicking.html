<p> Last Friday, during a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the National Anthem, taking the opportunity to protest racial oppression in the United States, and plans to continue his protest until 'real change' progresses.  Reaction has not surprisingly been mixed, with some praising him for taking a stand while others are criticizing him for it.  Kaepernick is not the first athlete to use his status to protest civil rights, nor will he be the last, but the question remains, will his refusal to stand actually bring any change?</p>

		<h4>Colin Kaepernick</h4>
</div>
	<p>Sports, more than anything, can bring people together, something we saw after 9/11 and the Boston Marathon attacks.  So in that regard, perhaps sports can help solve our human rights issues.  But we've seen this happen before with little success.  The biggest success was having Jackie Robinson break the color barrier in baseball.  Another success was Jesse Owens winning multiple gold medals in the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany.  But other athlete protests have done nothing but made said athletes merely a symbol of protests.  Tommie Smith and John Carlos with the Black Power salute at the 1968 Olympics were courageous to do so, but that's what they're best known for.  Former NBA player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf refused to stand for the National Anthem during the 1996 for similar reasons as Colin Kaepernick, but his career was never the same after that.  Same thing with Craig Hodges, whose NBA career was all but over after he handed a note to President George H.W. Bush at the White House protesting the treatment of minorities.  For many of the previous examples, these athletes were not notable enough, and thus, didn't have the ability to reach the masses like Michael Jordan, who famously never championed any political causes during his playing career.  The only notable athlete to protest and spread awareness for causes was the late Muhammad Ali, who sacrificed everything to avoid fighting in the Vietnam War.  In that regard, Colin Kaepernick has a steep hill to climb.</p>

    <p>But while things may not have been effective in the past, things are different in 2016.  Social media is rampant and people hear about things in an instant.  Celebrities make their thoughts more public (for better or worse) through Twitter.  We live in a society more aware of racist undertones and more willing to call others out for it.  So maybe now is the time for real progress.  But Colin Kaepernick's career has been on a downhill for the past few years since his miracle run to the Super Bowl.  The fact to the matter is is that no one noticed Kaepernick's refusal to stand for the National Anthem the first two games since he was injured.  One person alone, unfortunately, can not make a difference, whether it's myself, Colin Kaepernick or President Obama.  Kaepernick has a right to stand (or not stand for in his case) for what he believes in, but let's be honest, his actions won't change anything.  Speaking up is a step in the right direction, but collaboration goes further.</p>

		<img src="/img/salute.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Black Power Salute" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Tommie Smith and John Carlos (center and right) with the Black Power Salute</h4>
</div>

    <p>As long as the broken system pits us against one another, our society will never change.  As it is, Kaepernick still lives in a world that pits people against each other.  In his case, it's the African Americans against Law Enforcement, and whether Kaepernick is pitting people against each other is his intention, it's clear that Law Enforcement doesn't approve of his actions.  The San Francisco Police Department called his actions "embarrassing" and "disrespectful."  Standing (or not standing) in protest does little to bridge the gap between said groups necessary to bring real change.  Real change requires everyone on the same page and protest together.  Unfortunately, there's no trust between the two, and that's the biggest challenge.</p>
    
    <p>Though some question Kaepernick's actions, no one should question his intentions or his passion for speaking up.  It may not be the best way to call for change, but perhaps making a provocative stand, in this day and age, can at least get people talking.  As it is, a lot of people have been talking about it.  Earlier in the year, NBA stars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul spoke about racial justice at the ESPY awards, and though it was good for them to speak up, it didn't quite grab the attention that Kaepernick clearly has with his profound statement.  In that regard, going bold can be effective in getting people to talk, which sometimes is half the battle.</p>
