<p> It's only the end of November, and already, the young new Lakers have proven that not only is the Kobe era over, but that they're much further ahead of schedule than anyone anticipated.  The young Lakers just won a close game in Chicago tonight, with a 10-10 record, already more than half the wins they had all of last year.  The Lakers have been the biggest surprise in the league this year and there are plenty of reasons to love these Lakers.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/luke-walton.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Luke Walton" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Luuuuuuuuuuke Walton</h4>
</div>
    <p>Luke Walton was always a fan favorite when he played with the Lakers as a young'un, the passion and energy of his play made him an important asset.  It's what made Luke the first and only choice to take over the coaching job after Byron Scott was fired.  Luke Walton did wonders holding the talented Warriors afloat while Steve Kerr was out.  Yet his job with the Lakers has been so much better so far.  No real stars yet on this Lakers team, but plenty of talented young players who work hard and play hard.  These guys embody the style of play Luke Walton brought when he was a player, and he's an obvious choice for Coach of the Year right now.</p>
       <p>One thing the Lakers have proven this year so far is that their bench is not only the best and most productive in the league, it's almost as good as their starting five.  The Lakers have the Sixth Man of the Year on the roster but is it Jordan Clarkson or Lou Williams?  Sweet Lou Williams has won the award before and is born to succeed off the bench.  He currently ranks third in the league in fourth quarter points.  That's what Lou Williams does, and he's helped give the Lakers bench an identity.  Jordan Clarkson, on the other hand, is new the the bench role, and has flourished in the role, bringing a bench sidekick for Lou but also provides toughness and swagger on the defensive side of the court.  And while Lou Williams is the veteran leader of the bench, it's Larry Nance Jr. and his hustle that defines the Lakers character more than anyone.  His ability to go after loose balls, fight on every play and bring down the house with every slam (all of which would make his dad proud) is just what makes the Lakers tough to play against.  They always come out with the energy.  Also on the bench is rookie Brandon Ingram, who's shown potential to be a great player down the road, and Tarik Black, who has been a quality backup center when needed.</p>

		<h4>Lou Williams</h4>
</div>
       <p>Before the season started, I thought D'Angelo Russell would be the most improved player.  While he has improved from his rookie season, it's his surprise backcourt mate, Nick Young, who has been the real most improved on the team.  When Nick Young, aka Swaggy P, first joined the team, he gave the Lakers some entertaining value with his offense and fun attitude.  He fit well with Mike D'Antoni, even though he was not the right coach for the team.  But he fell off the face of the Earth under Byron Scott; not a good fit at all, and some doubted Nick Young would even make the team.  But Luke Walton has managed to light a fire in Nick Young, not only offensively, but on the defensive side as well.  He's managed to do a complete 180 from before, where I thought the Lakers would be better off trading him, to suddenly being an important asset alongside the last player anyone thought he would ever share a backcourt with, D'Angelo Russell.  Truth be told, Nick Young was getting too 'Hollywood' while he was with Iggy Azalea.  The last thing the Lakers needed was another Lamar Odom.  So I'll salute Nick Young for his comeback.  Who knew he'd be the longest tenured Laker currently on the roster.</p>
       <p>The rest of the Lakers starting lineup provides toughness and stability (when healthy, of course), as Julius Randle continues to improve his game at the Power Forward position, while Luol Deng, although not putting up the numbers in the past, provides a calming presence to the team.  His veteran leadership is important, especially for the growth of Brandon Ingram.  Even Timofey Mozgov, no matter how overpaid he is, has proven to be a good enough player for Luke Walton's system to sometimes make you forget that.  Definitely an improvement from Roy Hibbert last year.</p>

		<h4>Swaggy P got that Swagger Back</h4>
</div>
       <p>The Lakers have the perfect attitude and style of play that makes opponents not want to play them.  They're young, hungry, hard-working and passionate whenever they play.  It gives Laker fans like me hope for the future.  They've already beaten Golden State, Oklahoma City, Atlanta (twice, sucks to be you Dwight Howard!) and Chicago.  They've come back from 10+ point deficits, gone wire to wire, and never quit.  The Lakers aren't title-ready yet; they lack a closer like Kobe in his prime, but the Lakers are well ahead of schedule.  Thankfully, the Lakers are in good position to finally give up that first round pick they gave to Phoenix (now with Philadelphia) for the bad deal for Steve Nash.  The future is now for Luke Walton's Lakers, and it's about time the league started to fear the Lakers again.  The past few years were painful and sad, and the league better watch out.  The only thing to make it even better would be to have Larry Nance Jr. enter the Slam Dunk contest steal the title from Zach LaVine.  That would be really sweet, he was born to win it.</p>
