<p> As the Toronto Raptors defeated the Miami Heat in seven games, the Western and Eastern Conference Finals are now set.  It’s been a crazy ride so far, with surprise endings in some cases, but with four teams left to win the NBA Championship, who will win it all.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/lowry.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kyle Lowry" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>It wasn’t pretty, but Kyle Lowry led Toronto to their first Eastern Conference Finals.  Tough challenges await.</h4>
</div>
	<p>It’s no surprise that the Golden State Warriors made it back to the Western Conference Finals, but their ride there has been nothing short of expected.  With Steph Curry a little banged up, missing four games, it seemed like Golden State would get challenged by the surprise Portland Trail Blazers.  And for the most part, they were tested, but with each test, Golden State proved to be just a little better, and with Steph Curry returning in Game 4, he saved his best in a thriller, scoring the majority of his points in the second half and overtime after a cold start.  In typical Steph Curry fashion, he put on a show, and while becoming the NBA’s first unanimous MVP ever, proved just how insane his game truly is.  Though Portland played great, the Golden State Warriors showed how elite they are, winning the series 4-1.</p>
	<p>Most people, myself included, expected a Golden State-San Antonio matchup.  The Spurs played great during the season, and if not for the Warriors historic success, would have had the best record in the league.  But the Oklahoma City Thunder showed just how dangerous their duo of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook (or should it be Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant) truly are, surprising the Spurs in a well fought series, winning 4-2.  With Russell Westbrook being perhaps the most underrated player in the NBA (someone I think compares favorably to Curry himself and arguably has a better all-around game but people considered not on that level), it’s no wonder the Spurs simply could not stop him, while Kevin Durant played his typical high scoring game.  But it was their defense, with the vastly underrated play of Steven Adams that really pushed them to the next level.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/westbrook.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Russell Westbrook" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Russell Westbrook’s style of play makes him impossible to defend...</h4>
</div>
	<p>The Eastern Conference, meanwhile, saw Cleveland easily sweeping the Atlanta Hawks behind some of the most insane three-point shooting outside of Golden State, where the Cavs made 25 threes in one game, a truly mind boggling performance.  Though the Eastern Conference improved from last year, it’s still not as strong as the West, as LeBron James and company are still clearly the best team in the East, sweeping both Detroit and Atlanta.  They’re playing their best ball by far right now, but whether they can beat Golden State or Oklahoma City remains to be seen.</p>
	<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/curry2.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Steph Curry" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>But Steph Curry’s game is even harder to stop.  An elite duel awaits!</h4>
</div>
<p>On the flipside is the Toronto Raptors, making it to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time.  They didn’t dominate by any means, losing both Game 1’s at home, but they fought, scratched and clawed their way past Indiana and Miami, with both series going to Game 7.  And though Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan struggled at times, they came up big when their team needed it most, especially Lowry, who remains the heart and soul of the Raptors club.</p>

<p>The Eastern Conference Finals looks lopsided to me.  I would be surprised if Toronto won more than one game, and would totally expect Cleveland to pull another sweep.  Perhaps Toronto can pull off the Game 1 upset due to Cleveland’s rust from all the time off, but Cleveland is leaps and bounds above Toronto.  Lowry will keep them close in at least one of their home games, but not enough consistency from DeRozan spells trouble for Toronto.  Miami would have had a better shot of winning against Cleveland, but injuries to Hassan Whiteside (not to mention Chris Bosh not available for the series) killed an otherwise outstanding performance from Dwyane Wade, keeping them from advancing.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/lebron.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="LeBron James" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>No matter how much you may dislike LeBron James, you know you simply can’t stop him.</h4>
</div>
<p>The Western Conference Finals on paper looks like a better matchup, as a series with Curry, Westbrook, Durant, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green bring plenty of star power.  But while Westbrook and Durant will be hard to stop, the Warriors are on another level with Curry on the court.  There’s not a player like him, and though his shooting is mind-boggling and his offensive game his beyond crazy, it’s his supporting cast that makes them historically great, mainly the play of the impossible-to-defend Draymond Green, whose all-around game gives opponents headaches.  Oklahoma City will put up a good fight like Portland, but Golden State will find its way to victory.  I project Golden State to win the series in 5 games.</p>

<p>A potential repeat of last years Finals would be historically great, just like last year’s series was.  Cleveland played their hearts out last year without Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.  The way they are playing right now, Cleveland shouldn’t be taken lightly, and they definitely have peaked at the right time.  But the Western Conference is a different beast, and Steph Curry and the Warriors are setting the tone for a new era in the NBA.  It won’t be easy for the Warriors, as long as LeBron is around, but in the end, the Warriors are my choice to cap off their historic season winning the NBA title again.  No one saw this coming five years ago, but Golden State has put together an impossible-to-beat roster without a dominating big man, something only Michael Jordan’s Bulls could pull off.</p>
<p>The craziest season perhaps in NBA history is coming to an end, and with an even crazier summer coming, I expect to see some of the most exciting basketball to be played out in the coming weeks.  Still, the NBA Lottery on Tuesday will mean the most personally to me.  Can the Lakers win the lottery?  Will they even get a top pick?  Stay tuned, it’s going to be one heck of a show</p>

<h3>NBA Lottery Notes - May 17, 2016</h3>
<p>As a Laker fan, I can rejoice, they get to keep their pick, that is the good news.  Of course, the Lakers finish Number 2 again, except this year that was were they were supposed to be.  The winner of the lottery: the god-awful Philadelphia 76ers, the worst team in the league.  At least the Lakers didn't have to give them their pick.  The highlight of the night...my sister thought the Phoenix Suns representive at the Lottery had a last name of Booger.  Here's to you Devin Booker...or should I say, Devin Booger.</p>
