            <p class="intro">Week 3, unlike the week before, featured a lot of challenging match-ups, and for the first time ever, the Top 3 ranked teams in the AP poll play on the road against other ranked teams.  Alabama at Ole Miss, Florida State at Louisville and Ohio State at Oklahoma.  Safe to say, champions are made here.  Other plenty of entertaining games abound.  So what happened on Week 3?  Here are my thoughts.</p>

            <p class="intro">On paper, Week Two looked to be the worst weekend of college football ever.  No ranked teams facing each other, more ranked teams playing FCS weaklings than fellow Power 5 teams, and just one ranked team on the road, #13 Louisville playing at Syracuse in an ACC Showdown.  But life has plenty of surprises, as Week 2 provided more entertainment than on paper.  Week 3 promises to be better in terms of quality matchups, but here are my thoughts on what happened in Week 2.</p>

            <p class="intro">As further proof of the seasons changing, the NFL season is about to start, with a Thursday night rematch of Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos vs. the Carolina Panthers.  It should be an exciting year in the NFL, with a lot of notable events in the offseason and plenty of more on the way.  Which team will surprise this year?  Which team will disappoint this year?  Who wins the MVP?  Here's my thoughts on the NFL season on the horizon.</p>

            <p class="intro">Thank god football's back. It's refreshing to take interest in something besides politics
                and this ridiculous election. Week One is under wraps, and though only a handful of games carry any
                value, it's only the beginning. Here's my thoughts.</p>

            <p class="intro">Last Friday, during a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Quarterback Colin
                Kaepernick refused to stand for the National Anthem, taking the opportunity to protest racial oppression
                in the United States, and plans to continue his protest until 'real change' progresses. Reaction has not
                surprisingly been mixed, with some praising him for taking a stand while others are criticizing him for
                it. Kaepernick is not the first athlete to use his status to protest civil rights, nor will he be the
                last, but the question remains, will his refusal to stand actually bring any change?</p>

            <p class="intro">Next week is the unofficial start of the College Football season, and after a boring summer
                filled with boring baseball, I'm ready for some football. Although it officially started 'last night'
                when Cal played Hawaii halfway around the world in Sydney, Australia, next week is the start for the
                rest of us. As someone who spent three years at the University of Oregon and one and a half years at the
                University of Minnesota, I have two teams to follow, and as long as they don't play each other, I don't
                have to decide. So here are my thoughts on the upcoming football season.</p>

            <p class="intro"><strong>4:32 pm - </strong>Tonight is the 2016 NBA Draft, where the young stars join their
                new teams. For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like
                they did last year with D'Angelo Russell. While Russell
                wasn't an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype. Who will the Lakers take
                with the number 2 picks. All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be
                announced in 10 minutes.</p>

            <p class="intro">On Friday night, late in the evening, I found out that Muhammad Ali, the legendary boxer,
                had passed away at the age of 74. Though I'm not a boxing fan and I don't know any boxing fans, there
                was always one boxer that everyone knew about, Mr.
                Muhammad Ali. Though some would argue that Mike Tyson is equally famous, he was known for the wrong
                reasons. But Muhammad Ali is not only the greatest, as he frequently claimed, but he was the most
                important athlete of the 20th Century in
                any sport.</p>

            <p class="intro">The NBA Finals have arrived, featuring as I expected, a rematch of last year's Finals,
                Golden State vs. Cleveland. Last year, Cleveland, despite missing Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, played
                their hardest, gave Golden State a legitimate scare before
                Golden State was able to win their first championship in 40 years. Things have changed slightly this
                year, with the aforementioned Irving and Love healthy this time around, while Golden State, with not
                much change, finished with an NBA record
                73 wins in the regular season. So who wins the rematch? Here are my thoughts.</p>

            <p class="intro">After watching seven games of the Golden State-Oklahoma City series, I have come to the
                conclusion that no matter how talented you are, you need a signature look to gain attention from the
                common-man. Sure, Kevin Durant is quite talented, he shoots
                well and is one of the most feared offensive players in the league, but while I was watching this
                series, it was Steven Adams and his long hair, long mustache and tattoos that got all my attention, as
                well as an interesting back-and-forth
                between my Mom, her boyfriend, my sister and I on whether Adams is good-looking or not.</p>

            <p class="intro">Growing up, I didn't think much of the Los Angeles Clippers. Why should I have? They were a
                complete joke, a bumbling group of losers who couldn't win squat, couldn't put together a decent roster
                and worst of all had an incompetent owner who wouldn't
                spend any money to keep what little talent they had. It wasn't until the other owners handed them Chris
                Paul in an effort to keep him from being traded to the Laker did the Clippers finally start to look like
                a real basketball team. But as
                the Lakers sunk to the floor, have the Clippers overtaken them? Not even close. No matter how talented
                the Clippers are, they’ll always be in second place, and incapable of winning the title. Whether they
                like it or not, they are defined by
                their disgraceful former owner Donald Sterling.</p>

                really trying to reach 50 points. The announcers mentioned
                that could be the case in the first quarter. I would have been happy with 40 points. The plan was to sit
                Kobe the first half of the fourth quarter. That didn’t happen. Suddenly, the race to 50 was on.</p>

            <p class="intro">When it comes to the NBA, there are two types of players who dominate; players with amazing
                skills and smarts, and players with an unmatched physical advantage, players I like to call ‘a physical
                freak of nature.’ While players like Michael Jordan
                and Kobe Bryant will come and go, the physical freaks are rarer, and though not all players in the
                category are elite, the ones who do are able to use their advantageous attributes effectively and
                skillfully. Today, it comes as no surprise
                that Shaquille O’Neal, a man who needs no introduction, was selected to join the Basketball Hall of
                Fame. There was never a player like Shaq when he was playing, and with the changing of the style of play
                in professional basketball, there
                will probably never be a player as dominant and larger-than-life as Shaq, both physically and
                verbally.</p>

            <p class="intro">This year’s March Madness has truly personified to term Madness, to say the least. My
                bracket was shot early on, as Michigan State, my pick to win it all, got shocked by Middle Tennessee
                State, in what was statistically one of the biggest upsets
                ever. High seeds including West Virginia (3), California (4) and multiple 5 seeds, Purdue and Baylor
                were upset as well. My upset picks didn’t pan out, except for Gonzaga over Seton Hall and VCU over
                Oregon State, but not nearly as impressive
                as Middle Tennessee State, Little Rock, Yale, Stephen F. Austin and Hawaii winning. Here are my thoughts
                on the Tournament as a whole.</p>

                Which 12 seeds will pull off the upsets? And will this finally be the year a #1 seed loses to a 16th

            <p class="intro">As a Minnesota Vikings fan, I watched the 2014 NFL Draft hoping for two things. One was
                that the Vikings would take a quarterback that would be their franchise quarterback, and the other was
                that they wouldn't wind up with Heisman winning Quarterback
                Johnny Manziel. The Vikings needed a quarterback, but Johnny Manziel was not only a terrible fit for the
                Vikings, but he was and is to this day, a party boy who wants to be a celebrity with little focus on the
                game.</p>

            <p class="intro">Super Bowl 50 is on its way, featuring a match-up of the NFL's top two defenses, the Denver
                Broncos and Carolina Panthers (1 and 2 respectively). The biggest headline will likely be the probable
                MVP this year, Carolina QB Cam Newton, a very talented
                but cocky player. There are quite a few people that find Cam Newton obnoxious and arrogant, whether it's
                his me-first attitude or his 'Dab' dancing whenever he scores a touchdown. But on the other hand, how
                can you hate someone with a smile
                like his?</p>

                between #1 Clemson and #2 Alabama. A fitting championship game between the two best teams in the

                offense and Alabama completely shutting Michigan State down, it's clear these two were on a collision

                many fans might have had after a well-played 2014 season, but yet despite the bumps in the road,
                Minnesota is showing signs of life as a competitive football
                team. Whether 2016 will be any better remains to be seen, but at the moment, Minnesota did vanquish at

            <p class="intro">On the night of the 2015 NBA Draft, many people turned in to see which young prospects
                their team would select. Though the NBA Draft was held in Barclays Center (home of the Brooklyn Nets),
                it's fans of the New York Knicks (who play in the Madison
                Square Garden, the traditional home of the draft) that are the loudest and most obnoxious. Many of their
                fans don't know a whole lot about all the prospects, mostly knowing those they see on TV, i.e. those who
                play for big time college basketball
                teams, which is why, when the New York Knicks selected a young Latvian kid named Kristaps Porzingis,
                they loudly booed the selection.</p>

                cool to wear them. Some of them I bought for the design, like Grant Hill's Detroit Pistons jersey with
                the horse logo (what would you expect, I was young
                and loved the animal logos, even the Toronto Raptors Dinosaur logo which, like Detroit's logo then
                looked hideous by today's standards). Others were for my local team that I liked growing up, the
                Portland Trail Blazers, that of the great Arvydas
                Sabonis. I even got a throwback jersey of Dr. J from the Philadelphia 76ers. But there's one jersey
                which I still have to this day as a collector item, a rookie jersey of Kobe Bryant.</p>

                be honest, the Lakers have no shot of winning in Golden State. It's 20-7 as I type this sentence. But

                have to be this way, but yet I passionately hate USC more than any football program in college sports.
                Not schools like Oregon State and Washington, nor schools like Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan, rival
                schools of Oregon (where I started)

            <p class="intro">Two weeks ago, Jerry Kill, the football coach of the Gophers, retired due to health
                concerns. It seemed as if Minnesota would plummet to mediocrity yet again. But despite the loss of Kill,
                the program made leaps and bounds in terms of success,
                fan appreciation and continuity while he was there. Fanfare was much higher than it was when I went
                there in 2006, with JerrySota becoming a common phrase for Gopher fans. They had two choices: Keep
                things the way it was and retain trusty
                defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys as its coach, or go in a different direction. Choosing continuity
                over uncertainty, Minnesota made the right choice to keep Claeys as Head Coach.</p>
