<p> Just when it looked like the Gophers program was starting to build, the administration fired head coach Tracy Claeys.  Why?  Because during the player boycott, Tracy Claeys sent a tweet in support of the players.  Did he phrase his tweet correctly?  Perhaps he could've said things differently, something he admitted.  But Claeys did not deserve to get fired over this.  There's obviously a big mess between the players and the administration and Claeys should not have been made a scapegoat.  So what now?</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Tracy Claeys</h4>
</div>
  <p>Problems like this clearly suggest a program in complete turmoil.  The administration has clearly played sides with respect to the sexual assault case, blindly siding with the alleged victim regardless of whether a sexual assault occurred or not.  It's understandable in this day and age to make sure any alleged victim gets treated fairly and not have their concerns immediately dismissed.  Baylor University's handling of multiple sexual assault cases with their football team clearly showed what happened when that approach is taken. But that doesn't mean the administration shouldn't give their players a chance to defend themselves either and play the role of public executioner.  We don't know whether a sexual assault took place, and the police found no conclusive evidence to charge any of the players with sexual assault.  So while the players acted inappropriately to an extent, it wasn't enough to conclusive say they criminally acted inappropriate.</p>
  <p>"Have never been more proud of our kids. I respect their rights &amp; support their effort to make a better world!"  That's the tweet that led the Gophers to fire Tracy Claeys.  It seems innocent enough to me, but obviously people misinterpreted that as a support for the suspended players, when it was in support of the whole team.  In this day and age, people have plenty of access to information, and it can spread like wildfire.  In a perfect world, Claeys would have put more thought in a tweet, but it's a tweet, not a press release.  Again, this is not a fireable offense.  If so, Donald Trump would have been fired from the presidential race 1,000 times over, rather than steal the election as he did.  This problem to me stems from a lack of communication between the players/coaching staff and the administration, as clearly, there's a severe disconnect between the two.</p>
  <p>The Gophers are in a big mess.  As I wrote before they hired Tracy Claeys, the Gophers needed stability and got it by keeping him to replace Jerry Kill, the model of stability, but the administration doesn't know what to do with it and appears to be too fearful of becoming the next Penn State, which is fine to a degree, but they forgot to give a damn about the team and players itself.  Players and coaches aren't going to respect that at all.  Now they'll be stuck with mediocrity and uncertainty unless they hire a home-run candidate, which is highly unlikely to happen.  Minnesota isn't a football mecca, nor is it willing to spend the money to become one.  I can't see the Gophers rising from this one, and whoever takes over is bound to have a mess on his hands.</p>
  <p>The new AD Mark Coyle claims other reasons led to this decision: recruiting, ticket sales, program culture.  Clearly, Coyle has no clue that stability helps with recruiting, which leads to winning, which leads to better ticket sales.  Program culture is more complex than just claiming that an alleged sexual assault is a bad sign of the overall program culture.  Everyone, from the players to the students to the administration must be held at the highest standard and be effectively able to communicate with one another.  That lack of trust is what's driving the program down, and will be difficult to repair.</p>
  <p>Currently, the most obvious preferred candidate to take over is Western Michigan's PJ Fleck.  He's a young offensive minded coach, who led the Broncos to an undefeated regular season and making it to Cotton Bowl.  The Broncos lost to Wisconsin, 24-16 in a tough battle that proved at the least the Fleck and his squad belonged in the big game.  But would he really jump from a talented MAC team to a Big Ten team clearly in turmoil?  Who knows.  After that, the Gophers are stuck with mediocre to bad candidates.  Whether the Gophers hire the next Kirk Ferentz or the next Tim Brewster will always be on the back of the Gophers faithful minds, as they lost the one thing keeping them together: Stability.</p>
