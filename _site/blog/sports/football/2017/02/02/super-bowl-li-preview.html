<p> It's that time of year again.  Another NFL has come and gone, and there’s one game left, the granddaddy of them all, the Super Bowl.  This year, the Super Bowls being played in Houston, in a classic David vs. Goliath battle.  Clearly, the big bad Goliath is the New England Patriots, the most disliked team in the NFL, who always find ways to stay on top, even when they spy and deflate their way to victory.  On the flip side is the Atlanta Falcons, in just their second Super Bowl ever, who started the season with less super bowl bets than the god-awful Cleveland Browns (Editor’s Note:  I’m still open to take over as their  <strong><a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2016/10/10/why-i-should-be-the-next-starting-quarterback-of-the-cleveland-browns">starting quarterback</a></strong>).  Can the Atlanta Falcons do what no other team, minus the New York Giants (twice) did in the Super Bowl and beat the Patriots?  Or are we doomed to live in a hell hole of football agony that we’re already suffering in real life at the hands of evil Dictator Donald Trump?  Here are my thoughts.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Matt Ryan</h4>
</div>
<p>Watching the Atlanta Falcons this postseason, I was very surprised with how complete of a team they have been.  Most casual fans of the game only heard of the great Matt Ryan-Julio Jones combo, and that is their best weapon.  But the Falcons were a lot more dangerous than just those two.  Their running game provides a classic bruising-speed combo with Devonta Freeman leading the way, and with Tevin Coleman providing the burst of speed when needed.  Their receiving core is more than just Julio Jones.  Mohamed Sanu has always played well as a number two receiver, and with the Falcons offensive scheme, they have plenty of more targets open.  Offensively, Matt Ryan is obviously the cornerstone; the big reason why Atlanta is playing in the Super Bowl and his play this year deserves league MVP honors.  Not only is Matt Ryan a great passer, but he is unflappable, even when the cards are stacked against him.  His third-down statistics this post-season, particularly against Green Bay in the NFC Championship game, were mind-boggling, and he made it look really easy at times completing third-and-10 passes for the first down.  Ryan’s always had the talent, but with a strong offensive line, great offensive coaching and more discipline, he took his game to the next level, leading the Falcons to a Super Bowl and the NFL’s top ranked offense.  But not since Kurt Warner and the “Greatest Show On Turf” St. Louis Rams of 1999 has the NFL’s top ranked offense in the regular season ending up winning the Super Bowl that year.  Can the Falcons break that curse this time around?</p>

<p>To do so, Atlanta has to beat the best all-around team in the NFL the past 20 years, the most efficient and perhaps smartest, deadly lethal quarterback to ever play the game, and the best and longest-tenured coach in the NFL, the dynamic duo of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.  We all know the story of Tom Brady. Sixth round draft pick, 199th overall in 2000, rose up to be the starter, and now at 39 years old, has looked better than ever.  Now more than ever, Tom Brady is motivated to win his fifth Super Bowl, fresh off a four-game suspension to start the season for Deflategate.  The Pats have only lost twice this year and have looked damn near unstoppable at times, despite the lack of superstar playmakers surrounding Tom Brady (Editor’s Note: Rob Gronkowski is a freak of nature and the NFL’s best Tight End, but he’s injured).  So how does New England do it?  It starts with elite coaching, smart quarterback play and a defense that’s talented enough to slow down the league’s number one ranked offense.  New England will obviously have its hands full with Atlanta’s elite passing game, but have the Super Bowl experience that Atlanta lacks, starting with the man with the toughest assignment, cornerback Malcolm Butler, who gets to cover Julio Jones just two years after his Super Bowl heroics by intercepting Russell Wilson’s fourth-and-one pass from the one-yard line even though they had Marshawn Lynch on the field with the game on the line.  Defense wins championships and New England clearly has the ability to slow down Atlanta’s offense, but could this be the year Atlanta breaks the offense curse?</p>

</div>
<p>One issue the Falcons will have is obviously, they won’t have home-court advantage for the big game.  Chances are that will have an effect on the team.  While the offense is bound to slow down a bit, the defense is what will really need not to bleed in order to stop the Patriots.  The Falcons struggled with defense earlier in the year, but have played much better in the past two months.  They’ve faced Super Bowl playing quarterbacks in their past four games, dating back to the regular season, with Cam Newton, Drew Brees, Russell Wilson and Aaron Rodgers all seeing defeat to the Falcons D, but Tom Brady is a different beast than all of them.  As we saw two years ago, the Patriots are adept in short successful passes that can milk the clock to keep the Falcons from time of possession.  It’s up to the Falcons defense to prevent Brady from getting comfortable so they can get the ball and attack.  One player to watch is the sacks leader, Vic Beasley Jr., who is looking to replicate the Von Miller role from last year’s Super Bowl.</p>   

<p>So how does the big game play out?  Atlanta is not surprisingly the underdog.  But they’ve been the underdog all season.  I predicted a mediocre season for Atlanta and didn’t think they would be able to beat Seattle and/or Green Bay in the playoffs.  But they’ve surprised everyone so far, and they certainly won’t be afraid of playing Tom Brady and the Patriots.  Matt Ryan has played out of his mind the past six weeks or so, and has looked damn near unstoppable at times.  Of course, Tom Brady and the Patriots have also looked damn near unstoppable as well, despite the lesser talent surrounding Brady.  They’ve even managed to turn a Lacrosse player, Chris Hogan into a legitimate Wide Receiver.  Both teams to me are on a mission.  The Falcons as underdogs, and the Patriots as victims of the Deflategate scandal.  I’ve predicted Atlanta’s demise many times yet they keep winning, and I’d love to see them win their first Super Bowl, so I’m picking the Patriots to win by two touchdowns.  Experience and defense matter, from a practical point, which gives New England the advantage, but I’d love to see Atlanta prove me wrong, for the sake of underdogs, pride and sanity in this world.  With that said, knock ‘em dead Atlanta.</p>
