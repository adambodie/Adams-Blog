<p> Thank god football's back.  It's refreshing to take interest in something besides politics and this ridiculous election.  Week One is under wraps, and though only a handful of games carry any value, it's only the beginning.  Here's my thoughts.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/taiyon-devers.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tai'yon Devers" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Tai'yon Devers with two sacks, both fumbles recovered by the Gophers</h4>
</div>
<p>The Gophers played a tough game against Oregon State, managing to hold onto a 30-23 win despite some sluggishness in the passing game and three ejections from targeting.  Rodney Smith did a good job running and Mitch Leidner showcased his gutsy running on key downs.  Oregon State looked decent and are heading in the right direction, but still a young team, and it showed.  The first game of the season, obviously, but the Gophers will need to play better to take the next step.  Either way, the Gophers won the battle of the 'Rodents,' the only two Major FBS teams with rodent mascots.  Next up, FCS Indiana State.</p>

<p>Also playing Thursday night was my pick as most overrated team in the Top 10, Tennessee, who went above and beyond to prove their overrated-ness, just barely beating Appalachian State in OT, 20-13, exactly nine years to the day that the Mountaineers of Appalachian State pulled off their historic massive upset of Michigan.  Safe to say, Tennessee is not there quite yet.</p>

<p>On Saturday, my pick for most underrated team, Houston, played against Oklahoma in a battle of Top 15 teams.  The biggest game in Houston’s history, the Cougars surprised virtually everyone outside Houston by beating Oklahoma.  I'd figured Houston would play well, but exceeded expectations.  The game turned when Houston Auburned Oklahoma with a end-zone to end-zone missed field goal into a touchdown, reminiscent of Auburn’s famous play three years ago against Alabama.  Houston blew the game open after that.  Very impressive effort by Houston, whose Peach Bowl win against Florida State is a game of the past according to the team.  Great philosophy.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/royce-freeman.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Royce Freeman" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Royce Freeman was his usual self.</h4>
</div>
<p>The Oregon Ducks began their season against UC Davis, and of course, Oregon won 53-28.  Nothing too spectacular to say, except it was nice to see Pharaoh Brown back after his horrific injury.  Dakota Prukop played as well as one would expect against an FCS team.  On the flip side, their jerseys weren't that great to me, not sure why their jerseys are gray for this game, but they go through so many combos we’ll probably never see it again.  And for the first time in 17 years, Autzen Stadium did not sell out their seats.  Next up, Virginia.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the games, here are my thoughts.  Once again, USC proved how consistently overrated they are, as defending champs Alabama completely rolled over them 52-6.  Never expected the lousy Trojans to win this game, but a good team would've kept it close.  USC on the other hand, just plain sucked. --- Navy had to pull a quarterback out of the stands to fill in after starter Tago Smith got injured.  Enjoy your fifteen minutes of fame, backup from the stands Malcolm Perry.  Georgia Tech barely beat Boston College in a game played in Dublin, Ireland.  If only Notre Dame had played against Georgia Tech, it would've been the perfect Irish matchup.  But please, no car bombs. --- Virginia, whom Oregon plays next week, lost to FCS power Richmond 37-20.  So much for having two legit Power 5 non-conference teams on the schedule.  At least there's Nebraska. --- Speaking of Nebraska, it was very sweet for them to bring out ten players during their first punt to honor Sam Foltz, who died in a car wreck in July.  Classy act.  Not classy was the scumbag who robbed his brother’s house while this was happening.  This scumbag, who was arrested today, but not identified as of yet, should become the most hated person in Nebraska. --- Northwestern lost to Western Michigan 22-21, which makes me wonder if the recently departed journalist John Saunders (R.I.P.), who went to Western Michigan, lifted them spiritually.  John Saunders was one of my favorites, he will be missed. --- Washington State again proved how unpredictable they are by losing to Eastern Washington 45-42.  They looked fairly good last year despite a loss to Portland State.  They follow up this year with a loss to another FCS team.  What in the hell is Mike Leach smoking?</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/houston.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Houston" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Houston turned the game in their favorite with this missed field goal returned for a touchdown.</h4>
</div>
<p>Week One doesn’t say a lot about the National Championship, but it’s safe to say that Oklahoma won’t win it like I predicted.  By no means does this mean they won’t make it to the playoffs, they can still win out the rest of their games and win the Big XII, but their defense isn’t as great as I thought.  I need to do some better research next time.  Of course, Houston, with its marquee win, has a chance to run the table and make the Playoffs itself.  They still have Louisville to play late in the regular season as a good non-conference game, but they have the talent to go undefeated in the American Athletic Conference and crash the Power 5 Playoff Party.  With that, here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>

<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Clemson</li>
<li>Florida State</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Michigan State</li>
<li>Houston</li>
<li>Stanford</li>
<li>Oklahoma</li>
<li>LSU</li>
<li>Michigan State</li>
</ol>
