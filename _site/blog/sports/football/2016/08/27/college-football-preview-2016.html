    <div class="article">
<p> Next week is the unofficial start of the College Football season, and after a boring summer filled with boring baseball, I'm ready for some football.  Although it officially started 'last night' when Cal played Hawaii halfway around the world in Sydney, Australia, next week is the start for the rest of us. As someone who spent three years at the University of Oregon and one and a half years at the University of Minnesota, I have two teams to follow, and as long as they don't play each other, I don't have to decide.  So here are my thoughts on the upcoming football season.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/leidner.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mitch Leidner" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mitch Leidner</h4>
</div>
    <p>As previously mentioned, I would hate for Oregon and Minnesota to play each other.  It's a good thing that Minnesota instead chose to open its season against Oregon State.  Not only that, Oregon is too fast for Minnesota.  Oregon State had a disappointing season last year (2-10), but I can't imagine the Beavers being that bad again this season.  With that said, Minnesota is playing at home and has the more steady hand offensively, with Mitch Leidner back at the helm at Quarterback.  Gophers win, 24-14.</p>
    <p>This season, the Big Ten has decided to hold nine conference games, rather than the eight they have previously played.  That means one more conference opponent instead of a crappy non conference opponent. The rest of the Gophers non conference games are against FCS Indiana State and Colorado State.  Colorado State gave them a close game last year, and could very well do the same this year, but I imagine Minnesota will finish 3-0 in the non-conference.  As for their conference games, Minnesota has a far more easier slate of conference games than last year, when Minnesota had one of the toughest schedules imagined.  Rather than playing Michigan and Ohio State, Minnesota instead gets crossover matchups against Penn State, Maryland and Rutgers, who were three of the four worst teams in the Big Ten's East Division.  As it is, Iowa is the only ranked team (#17) on Minnesota's schedule.  The good news for Minnesota, they get Iowa at home.</p>
    <p>So how do the Gophers perform this season?  Should the Gophers get some consistency from Mitch Leidner and their offense, the Big Ten West is wide open for Minnesota to have a chance to steal the Big Ten West from Iowa.  Wisconsin isn't dominate like they have been recently, and perhaps Minnesota can finally win Paul Bunyan's Axe (obviously the most important game of the season).  Nebraska, Northwestern and Penn State are talented enough to match with Minnesota, so winning two of those games (if not all three) is essential.  Shannon Brooks, their leading rusher last year is injured, but should be ready for the Big Ten schedule.  Their passing game showed some signs last year but needs to make the next step in order for Minnesota to contend.  My prediction: Minnesota finishes a respectable 8-4, good for second in the Big Ten West.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/prukop.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Dakota Prukop" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Dakota Prukop</h4>
</div>    
    <p>As for the Oregon Ducks, who begin the season ranked #24 (AP) and #22 (Coaches Poll), the Ducks will once again have a new quarterback at the helm.  It was just announced yesterday, to little surprise, that FCS transfer, former Montana State QB Dakota Prukop will be the starter, and Justin Herbert, a true freshman from Sheldon High School, coming out of nowhere to supplant expected backup Travis Jonsen as the backup.  Prukop has the smarts and the footwork to be successful, although probably not as good as Vernon Adams was last year, Oregon still has plenty of offensive weapons starting with Heisman contender Royce Freeman, one of the best running backs in the country.  Their offense, assuming they stay healthy, will be fine.  Another thing to note is the return of Pharoah Brown, whose horrific injury two seasons ago nearly cost him his leg.  Any production from him will be welcomed as should he, as he's come a long ways, and was just named starting Tight End once again.  It's their defense that's killed them in the past.</p>
    <p>Oregon has never been known for their defense, and it killed them last year blowing a 31-0 lead at the Alamo Bowl.  Though Oregon's usually stayed in house, no one from Oregon could handle the job, as Don Pellum was demoted to Linebackers coach.  In comes Brady Hoke, the former Michigan coach holding a coordinator job for the first time.  Will Oregon's defense improve?  Hard to say with losing their best defensive players from last year (DeForrest Buckner).  They'll need it as Oregon plays plenty of tough games.</p>
    <p>Their non-conference schedule isn't anything special, with UC-Davis, Virginia and Nebraska on their plate, the latter game on the road against old nemesis Mike Riley.  Oregon should win all three of those games, heading into a conference schedule with three ranked teams, Washington (inexplicably ranked #14), USC (#20, yuck!) and Stanford (#8, again the toughest game of the year).  Can Oregon win the Pac-12 this year?  Will someone besides Oregon or Stanford win the Pac-12 North?  My hunch tells me Oregon will finish second behind Stanford again.  Oregon beat Stanford last year, but too many questions defensively for them to win the North.  My prediction: Oregon finishes 9-3, good for second in the Pac-12 North</p>
    <p>As for the rest of the College Football landscape, Alabama and Clemson start the season as they ended it, #1 and #2 respectively.  Oklahoma, making the Playoffs last year as well, is still loaded and ranked #3, while Florida State is ranked #4.  The Big Ten is led by Ohio State and Michigan, and could come down to the two long time rivals.  Stanford is the highest ranked team in the Pac-12, ranked #8 (AP) and #7 (Coaches Poll), with the electrifying Christian McCaffrey at running back.  One team that's ranked too high to start is Tennessee, in the Top Ten in both polls despite their past years of mediocrity.  One team ranked too low (not surprisingly as the best non-major conference team, Notre Dame not included) is Houston (#15, AP and #13, Coaches Poll), who surprised many last year by beating Florida State in the Peach Bowl convincingly, and returning many of their best players.  They begin their season at home against Oklahoma, and though Oklahoma is probably going to win, Houston has plenty of weapons to at least contend with the Sooners (especially at home) and make another BCS Bowl.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Christian McCaffrey</h4>
</div>       
    <p>Some other things that will intrigue me includes all of these things:  How will Baylor perform this year after their controversial summer with the firing of Art Briles for his lack of conduct over their numerous players arrested for various violent crimes?  Two teams I really hate play each other in the first game of the year: Alabama and USC.  Which team is more dispicable right now, the Crimson Tide and their big time success and complaining against Oregon-styled offenses, or the always dislikable USC that always gets ranked no matter how mediocre they really are.  LSU has had a crazy ride with floods affecting the state, particularly Baton Rouge, and the near firing of Les Miles.  How will they perform with all of this going on?  The Pac-12 has lots of talented teams, but since they joined the conference, Colorado has always been at the bottom, slowly creeping their way to respectability.  Is this the year Colorado finally makes the jump from bottom-feeder to respectable?  Lovie Smith, former Super Bowl coach for the Chicago Bears, finds himself as coach of Illinois.  That will be interesting to say the least.  </p>
    <p>The Heisman race has two top contenders right now, the aformentioned Christian McCaffrey and Clemson Quarterback DeShaun Watson.  Either one of these two players are talented enough to win the Heisman, but McCaffrey is dangerous no matter where on the field he is.  He's my preseason pick to win the Heisman Trophy.  As for Conference Champions and Playoff teams, here are my picks:  The ACC will once again come down to Clemson and Florida State, the clear two best teams in the conference.  Clemson is obviously talented but my gut tells me Florida State will beat them and win the ACC.  The Big XII has Oklahoma clearly as the best team in the conference, and it's unlikely that will change, as Oklahoma wins the Big XII.  The Big Ten has Ohio State, Michigan and Michigan State as the three best teams in the conference, but with Michigan State losing their leader Connor Cook at Quarterback and Ohio State losing a lot of studs, I pick Michigan to win the Big Ten behind the coaching of the obnoxiously lovable Jim Harbaugh.  The Pac-12 is wide open this year, with Oregon, Stanford, UCLA, Washington and USC all capable of winning the championship, but when it's all said and done, Stanford will repeat.  The SEC is once again ridiculously loaded at the top with Alabama the defending Champion, and they will repeat as SEC Champs again.</p>
    <p>The Third College Football Playoffs, as I see it, will feature Alabama, Oklahoma, Florida State and Michigan in that order, and when it's all said and done, I pick Oklahoma to win it all, being the most complete team in the nation, a stout defense and an electrifying offense led by Quarterback Baker Mayfield.  This season will be another doozy, that's for sure.</p>
