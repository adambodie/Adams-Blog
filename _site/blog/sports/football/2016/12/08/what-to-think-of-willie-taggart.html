<p> The Oregon Ducks have a new football coach, as they announced the hiring of South Florida coach Willie Taggart to become the new coach.  The Ducks interviewed multiple candidates, but in the end, hired Taggart over Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen.  Did the Ducks make the right hire? Here are my thoughts on the new Ducks head coach.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/willie-taggart.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Willie Taggart" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Willie Taggart</h4>
</div>
<p>Once Mark Helfrich was let go and the interview process began, multiple names became linked to the position.  Some were okay (Boise State head coach Bryce Harsin), some were bad (Ohio State Defensive Coordinator Greg Schiano), others were not interested (UCF head coach Scott Frost) and others seemed like a bad match (Western Michigan head coach PJ Fleck), yet Willie Taggart stood out as a good fit and had many of the qualities necessary to succeed in college football.  Oregon wasn't going to get a home run candidate (former coach Chip Kelly) but instead chose a young coach with all the right tools to succeed.</p>
<p>One quality Taggart has that makes for a successful coach is a great personality.  It's one of the many reasons he's received high praise from fellow coaches and former players.  Tony Dungy, one of the most respected men in football, had nothing but high praise for his coaching ability, as did Jim Harbaugh, whom Taggart served as an assistant at Stanford.  And the biggest recruit Taggart helped deliver during his time at Stanford, Andrew Luck, was also happy to give great reviews.  While coaches don't win on reviews, it's a positive sign to hear continued praise.  He showed it today in his introductory speech, showcasing a fiery and determined attitude that Oregon needs now more than ever.</p>
<p>Recruiting is an important part of coaching, and Taggart is considered to be a great recruiter.  He did get Luck to Stanford.  And equally important is being familiar with the big recruiting areas.  Taggart's familiarity with the state of California, where many of the best players hail from, is key.  It's also important for Oregon to recruit well in other regions far away, for example, Florida, where Taggart is also familiar with.  Can Oregon get a few great players from the Southeast or Texas like they have been doing, Oregon should be in good hands with Taggart.</p>
<p>The most important quality though, is winning.  Willie Taggart took two lousy teams, Western Kentucky and South Florida, and turned them into winners, improving win totals for each school for all but one of his eight seasons as a coach.  This past year, South Florida finished 10-2, the best record they've had in their short existence as a football program (1997), and accomplished this in just four years out from a program that was 3-9 the year before.  Likewise, at Western Kentucky, he turned a team that was winless the year before he arrived to a 7-5 team in two years, coaching them for three years.  At the end of the day, winning is what matters the most.</p>

		<h4 style="max-width: 400px">Willie Taggart with a great introduction</h4>
</div>
<p>Of course, there are concerns, as there is for any coach from a smaller school making the leap to a big powerhouse.  Can he succeed against the bigger opponents?  Can he handle the hype Oregon has received the past decade?  And my biggest concern, can he fix Oregon's porous defense?  These are obviously big concerns for the Ducks, but there are plenty of questions ahead.  Will Brady Hoke even be around or can we mark this hire as a failed hire?  What kind of defensive scheme would Taggart bring in, knowing Oregon just switched defenses under Hoke to bad results.  Two of Oregon's best defensive players last season were Troy Dye and Brendan Schooler were true freshmen, giving them plenty of time to build up defensive talent.  The offense should be in good hands, as Justin Herbert is the starting Quarterback for the next two-three years if he continues to develop.</p>
<p>Willie Taggart has all the right tools to succeed at Oregon.  His youthful personality, relatability to his players, recruiting chops, and most of all, his success on the field makes him the best realistic hire for Oregon.  But Oregon fans need to be patient, success won't come overnight.  The Ducks made a similar choice on the basketball court with Dana Altman, and the Ducks have not looked back on the hardwood.  In a few years, perhaps they'll be in the same place with Taggart. Until then, I will be proud to continue showing my support for the Green and Yellow O.</p>
