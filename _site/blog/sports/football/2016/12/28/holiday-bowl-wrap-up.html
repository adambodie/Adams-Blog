<p> Entering the Holiday Bowl, all of the attention was on the Gophers and their pregame drama.  They were down 10 players, 4 in the secondary that were essential to stopping Washington State's Air Raid offense.  It seemed like all the cards were in Wazzu's favor.  But yet, there's a reason they actually play the game.  And there's also a reason that Wazzu and Mike Leach have never been conference contenders.  So what happened at the Holiday Bowl?</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/holiday-bowl.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Shannon Brooks" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Shannon Brooks scores on the offensive play of the game</h4>
</div>
<p>The first half of the game went exactly as Minnesota would have liked it to.  Their defense made things very difficult for QB Luke Falk, as he couldn't find his groove.  Their running game, which is obviously not a big part of their offense, couldn't provide any balance, as Minnesota allowed nothing to get through.  Their first drive was okay but settled for a field goal.  Minnesota's offense was predictably slow, but despite the lack of output, it was a field goal game in the first half, with Big Ten kicker of the year Emmitt Carpenter boinking a field goal in off the post.  It was 6-3 at the half, definitely not the score Wazzu, averaging about 40 points a game, wanted at the half.</p>
<p>Mike Leach referred to his offense as 'Anemic' at halftime.  Anemic wasn't a strong enough word.  Despite the Gophers pregame drama, they played like they wanted to be there.  Washington State didn't look like it cared to be there.  The third quarter was much of the same for the Cougars.  Luke Falk still couldn't find any groove, and the Gophers were at least able to capitalize offensively, with a combination of smart plays, timely catches and one very lucky deflection, with Shannon Brooks catching a touchdown pass that was deflected by a Wazzu defender right into his hands.  Touchdown Gophers, they took a 10-6 lead.</p>
<p>In the end, Wazzu had by far its worse offensive performance of the year.  The Gophers, even without 4 key secondary players, made the Cougars looked uncomfortable the entire game.  Even with a true freshman at Cornerback, whom Leach tried to pick on but failed to take advantage of, the Gophers stayed strong.  And for his last game as a Gopher, Mitch Leidner played well enough to lead the Gophers to a 17-12 win.  He didn't get a lot of yards in the air, but Leidner didn't make any major mistakes and arguably the Gophers had their best performance of the year.  They were the ones who showed up to the game.  The Cougars did not.  It took them until the last minute of the game to score a touchdown, and by the time then, it was a little too late.  Advantage: Gophers.</p>

		<h4>And the winner of the 2016 National Funding Holiday Bowl: The Minnesota Golden Gophers.</h4>
</div>
<p>The Gophers finish the year 9-4, with their best win in the Holiday Bowl.  They exacted revenge on Mike Leach, who beat the Gophers in the infamous Insight Bowl of 2006.  And it just confirms to me what a blowhard Mike Leach is.  He's more of a gimmick coach than anything else.  Great defenses turn Leach into the gimmick he really is, and Minnesota in particular, was embarrassing for the Cougars, who ended the year losing three straight to three talented defensive teams.  Most importantly, the Gophers stuck together and showcased their team spirit, despite the mess from the week before.  One team wanted to be there, and it wasn't the Cougars.  Despite the disagreement between Tracy Claeys and AD Mark Coyle over the suspensions, I hope they can see eye to eye and work together for the long haul.  Claeys had a good first year.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/wake-forest.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Wake Forest" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Wake Forest deserves kudos.</h4>
</div>
<p>As for the rest of the bowl games right now, there's only one team that could've used a win more the Minnesota, and like Minnesota, they too won last night.  That team was Wake Forest, who has been the unfortunate victim of what is being called 'WakeyLeaks,' thanks to a radio analyst and former assistant coach who was selling team plays to opponents.  No team should ever have to deal with crap like this.  The players and coaching staff worked hard to play their game, and someone connected to them betrayed them.  For whatever reason it was, whether out of spite for losing an assistant job, or for a possible gambling addiction, sharing private information is awful and wrong.  It's unfortunate that partisan hacks like Julian Assange continue to get away with this, and it's unfortunate that certain people paid little attention to the crimes being committed, rather than focusing on the information found.  It shouldn't happen anywhere.  But the Demon Deacons had their best season since 2008, beat a Top-25 ranked team in Temple, and gave their fans a reason to be happy.  Kudos for them.  As of yesterday, I am currently 9-12 with my bowl picks.  I'd gladly trade a Gophers win then have a perfect prediction record.  </p>
