<p> Bowl season has begun, and Minnesota, sitting at 8-4, has one more chance to prove they're on the right direction.  But all that took a backseat early in the week when 10 players were suspended indefinitely for an alleged sexual assault that took place in September.  The rest of the team, upset with the decision, boycotted the decision and threatened to skip the Holiday Bowl unless the 10 players were reinstated.  The boycott lasted two days, and while they're still down 10 players, the message is still as confusing and complex as ever.  What exactly have we learned from all of this?</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/drew-wolitarsky.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Drew Wolitarsky" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Drew Wolitarsky took charge for the Gophers</h4>
</div>
<p>Sexual assault is not something to take lightly.  It's certainly a big problem on college campuses all throughout the world.  In that regards, such accusations shouldn't be swept under the rug.  Baylor has learned this the hard way with their football team.  And this was investigated for the Gophers back in September.  Four of the players were suspended and couldn't play at home until a restraining order was lifted.  In that regards, the Gophers took the allegations seriously, which was obviously the appropriate thing to do.  Whether a crime was committed or not, it's not something to joke about.  But at the same time, there are three types of sexual assault cases that happen: Those where it's clearly sexual assault, those where it's clearly not sexual assault, and the murky 'he said, she said' cases where it's not clear whether sexual assault occurred or not.</p>
    <p>This case, like many, likely falls in the latter category.  The woman claims sexual assault, while the men claimed consent.  It's hard to say what happened, as like plenty of cases, there was plenty of alcohol/drugs involved.  The police declined to press any charges against any of the players, without any proof a crime happened.  While it's not to say any of these men are definitely innocent or guilty, in cases like this, it's easy to conclude that these men probably acted stupid and irresponsible.  It's never a good idea to have sex with someone who's drunk.  For that reason, these ten players were suspended for breaking school values.</p>
    <p>The problem with this decision, is that although it's understandable, it wasn't handled well on the school's behalf, due to the fact that the players weren't given a chance to defend themselves in front of the school leadership.  There are plenty of people who commit sexual assault, but there are also those who are falsely accused of sexual assault.  The infamous Duke lacrosse case from 2006 is a great example of this, as the players accused and the team weren't able to play that year all over a crime that did not happen.  Those who are falsely accused of sexual assault are victims as well, and have to suffer humiliation just like those who are sexually assaulted, even though it's a different kind of public humiliation.  People who are falsely accused of crimes deserve to be treated with respect as well, rather than be the victim of jumping to conclusions without any strong evidence.</p>
    <p>One positive for the Gophers in all of this is that it brought the team together in a way, to stand as one and have each others backs.  But even as it was clear that they weren't going to get their suspended teammates reinstated, they worked to get the best deal they could; a chance for the players to get fair due process.  This isn't a case of taking sides.  Victims of sexual assault deserve to be treated with respect, like the woman who was sexually assaulted by former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner.  People falsely accused of sexual assault also deserve to be treated with respect, like former high school football star Brian Banks, who spent years in prison and publicly shamed as a sex-offender for a crime he never committed.  And those cases in the middle, where it's a he-said/she-said situation, all deserve to be treated fairly as well.</p>
    <p>Now that this incident can be put behind us for the moment, the Gophers have a game to play.  It certainly will be tough for the Gophers to beat Washington State.  Their defense can only slow down Washington State's offense so much, and their offense isn't capable of keeping up.  They haven't played anyone this year like Washington State, and arguably their two best defensive backs, KiAnte Hardin and Antoine Winfield Jr., are amongst the ten players suspended. On paper, the question of whether Minnesota would even play in the game or not, will provide more fireworks than the actual game itself.  The one thing going for the Gophers, perhaps, is that Washington State may not be as motivated to play as Minnesota, the Cougars were in the Rose Bowl hunt until they got beat by Colorado and Washington.  It's possible this will fire up the Gophers a little bit, but it's clear Washington State is not an ideal matchup.  But then again, Washington State has lost its last two games to FCS teams (Eastern Washington and Portland State), so anything can happen.</p>

    		<h4>Donnel Pumphrey is now the FBS's all time leading rusher.</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The first bowl games were played yesterday, and though all of the matchups were between teams outside the major conferences, there was one game that featured star power: The Las Vegas Bowl between Houston and San Diego State.  Both teams beat major conference teams, Houston beating Oklahoma and Louisville, and San Diego State beating Cal.  But neither team was able to make a major push in their conference needed to make the New Year's Six Bowls or Playoffs, which undefeated Western Michigan received.  The main storyline of this game, however, belonged to San Diego State running back Donnel Pumphrey, who entered the game just 108 yards away from breaking the all time record owned by former Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne.  Houston bottled Pumphrey up in the first quarter, but Pumphrey exploded afterwards, ending up with 115 yards to break the record.  More games played aside than Dayne, an impressive feat from Pumphrey, who at 5'9", is one of the smaller running backs in the FBS.  Currently, I'm 2-4 with my bowl picks.  Grambling beat NC Central 10-9 thanks to a blocked extra point from a miracle NC Central touchdown.  New Mexico won its second bowl game in 55 years, winning the New Mexico Bowl over UTSA.  But San Diego State, Appalachian State, Southern Miss and Arkansas State all won yesterday.</p>
