<p> Championship Week is here, as most playoff contenders (sorry Ohio State) have one more chance to make that big statement they need to be in the final four.  Who wins, who loses, and who gets left home wishing that they hadn't lost that one game?  Here are my thoughts on the matter.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Alabama is clearly the best team in the country right now...again</h4>
</div>

    <p>The Pac-12 Championship Game was on Friday, between Washington and Colorado.  With the Huskies left as the only Pac-12 team with a realistic shot at making the playoffs, the Huskies dominated the game, beating Colorado 41-10 in a statement game they desparately needed.  The Huskies entered the game ranked 4th in the College Football Playoff ranking, and with a schedule not as strong as other contenders, Washington needed to set the best example against a high ranked Colorado team.  With an offense ranked 3rd in points for and 10th in points against, the Huskies have been consistently strong all season, and QB Jake Browning has played like a Heisman finalist most of the season.  With the chaos in the Big Ten, Washington may not be a lock to make the playoffs, but Washington, in my mind, is one of the top four teams in the country and definitely deserve to be there.</p>
    <p>The Big XII doesn't officially have a championship game yet, but today's matchup between Oklahoma and Oklahoma State serves as an unofficial championship game, as the winner of the game takes home the Big XII championship.  Unfortunately for the Big XII, the nonconference blemishes by both teams appear to have cost them a shot at the playoff.  Oklahoma played a tough nonconference schedule but lost to Houston and Ohio State.  They've been perfect in the Big XII, but those two losses, combined with an otherwise disappointing season for the other preseason favorites, led to the Sooners being unable to climb out of the hole they dug themselves into.  Oklahoma State, on the other hand, suffered a controversial loss to Central Michigan on a miracle play that should've never happened.  This might've been ignored had they not also lost to Baylor, who started the season 6-0 but have imploded since.  But at the end of the day, Oklahoma won the game 38-20.  I picked them at the beginning of the season to win the national championship, but they are not going to make the playoffs.</p>
    <p>The SEC championship game features Alabama, the best team in the country and Florida.  Alabama is a lock to make it back to the playoffs for the third straight year and a chance to defend their title, perfect on the year so far.  Even if they lost to Florida, they would still make it.  Thankfully, we won't have to envision that scenario.  Alabama won easily, 54-16.  Alabama, which began the season ranked #1, will easily enter the playoffs ranked #1, going wire to wire in that department.</p>
    <p>The Big Ten championship game is the oddball of the bunch as the two best teams in the conference aren't playing for it.  Ohio State, ranked number two in the country, finished tied for the Big Ten East, but tied with the only team to beat them, Penn State.  They face Wisconsin, the Big Ten West champion whose only two losses on the year came against the two best teams in the conference, Ohio State and Michigan.  The bigger question is, can the winner of this game make it to the playoff?  Ohio State is probably the best team in the Big Ten, but they aren't going to win the Big Ten title.  In a thrilling game, Penn State, down in the first half, came back in the second to win the Big Ten title.  The big question now becomes, will Penn State make the playoffs?  Penn State is perhaps the hottest team in the country not named Alabama, but yet they lost twice, to Pitt and Michigan, who blew Penn State out 49-10.  The Playoff committee has a tough decision to make, but Penn State to me, is the hot team, but not one of the best four teams.</p>

		<h4>What to do about Ohio State and the Big Ten?</h4>
</div>
    <p>The ACC Championship game between Clemson and Virginia Tech is as clear as any other conference championship game.  Clemson wins, they're in.  Clemson loses, they're out.  The game itself was a tough one for Clemson.  Virginia Tech proved to be a tough out and wouldn't go away.  But Clemson won a close game 42-35.  Clemson, although a little overrated in my opinion, has been one of the top four teams in the country and belong in the playoffs.</p>
    <p>Of course, they are plenty of other story lines for bowl positioning, such as who make the Group of Six Bowls.  The highest ranked team in the Group of 5 (the smaller conferences) gets a team in, and the battle entering the week was close between Western Michigan and Navy.  Western Michigan, unbeaten in the regular season, had a tough game in the MAC Championship game against Ohio, but ended up winning 28-23 to cap an unbeaten season.  Some people believe Navy is the better team as they played tougher opponents than the Broncos, although they lost twice.  But Navy needed to win the AAC Championship to make their case, but they lost to Temple 34-10, making Western Michigan the winner of the Group of 5.  Regardless of the fact, Western Michigan deserves to be rewarded for being unbeaten, it's not easy to do no matter the conference.  A Cotton Bowl appearance will now likely be on the horizon for the Broncos and young coach PJ Fleck, who figures to be coaching a major conference team next year (Oregon, anyone?).  Coaching changes are on the horizon, also a big headline, mainly for me as the Ducks need a new coach.  So far, Ohio State defensive coordinator Greg Schiano and USF head coach Willie Taggart have been talked to, along with PJ Fleck.  With that said, Schiano, despite the defensive pedigree, would be an awful choice for the Ducks.  His tough style would be a poor fit for the Ducks, which led to his demise coaching the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and has no West Coast ties.  Taggart, on the other hand, was the running backs coach at Stanford, and has made winners of Western Kentucky and South Florida, which is impressive, but I don't know that much else about him.  It will be a long coaching search. --- Louisiana Lafayette became the first team since 2012 to win a game without a single yard of passing.  Quarterback Anthony Jennings was 2-5 with zero yards passing and a QBR of 3.3 (and 2 INT's).  Even more messed up was that he had the higher QBR of the two quarterbacks, as Louisiana Monroe quarterback Caleb Evans had a QBR of 0.1, going 3-14 with 31 yards (also with 2 INT's).  It should be noted the Minnesota's new offensive coordinator, Jay Johnson, was the former offensive coordinator of the Ragin Cajuns of Louisiana Lafayette.  That explains everything. ---  With all that said, here are my picks to make the playoffs with seeds.</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Clemson</li>
<li>Washington</li>
