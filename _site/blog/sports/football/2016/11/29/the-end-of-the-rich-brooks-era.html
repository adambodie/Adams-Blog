<p> For as long as I’ve been a fan of the Oregon Ducks, which started with their 2001 Fiesta Bowl blowout against Colorado and blossomed when I went to school there for three years, I’ve always respected the football team’s family-styled approach to coaching.  Starting with Rich Brooks, who coached the Ducks from 1977 to 1994, when he brought the Ducks to respectability and a Rose Bowl appearance before departing for the NFL, the Ducks always had, for the most part, a close knit family tree of coaching, as the ‘Next Man Up’ mantra reigned supreme.  But that era has ended today as the Oregon Ducks fired Mark Helfrich as their head coach after a disappointing 4-8 season.  Whether he was the right coach or whether the Ducks will replace him with someone better remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure, the Ducks are now just another program looking to win.  So what happened?</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/mark-helfrich.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mark Helfrich" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mark Helfrich</h4>
</div>
	<p>Back in the day, it didn't matter how mediocre to bad Rich Brooks was as a coach; this year was their worst record since 1991 when Rich Brooks went 3-8.  But while the Ducks were patient back then with average expectations, times have changed and the Ducks are now impatient with extremely high expectations after reaching new heights with two National Championship appearances in the past six years.  After Rich Brooks left, the Ducks remained confident with the Rich Brooks way, bringing offensive coordinator Mike Bellotti as the coach.  And Oregon continued to blossom from a mediocre team to one that consistently made bowl games and competed for (then) Pac-10 titles.  But even the Ducks needed a boost, and Mike Bellotti managed to flip the program on its heels by bringing in a miracle guru from New Hampshire, Chip Kelly.</p>
	<p>The Ducks became the talk of the country when Chip Kelly, an unknown offensive coordinator from New Hampshire, took over as offensive coordinator and turned the offense on its heels.  And a couple of years later, Bellotti retired and handed the reigns to Chip, where the Ducks became the top team of the Pac-10 (later the Pac-12).  Suddenly, Oregon was a national powerhouse, with a high-flying offense that was difficult to stop and all the rage.  But despite keeping the family intact, Chip Kelly didn't share that ideal himself; feeling destined for greater things and bored of college football (along with minor violations that would’ve cost him anyhow), Chip took his talents to the NFL and like before, it was the next man up as Mark Helfrich, the offensive coordinator, was hired as the new head coach.</p>
	<p>But what started out as Mark's greatest strengths led to his downfall: Marcus Mariota.  Like Larry Coker, who led the great 2001 Miami Hurricanes to a National Championship in his first season as coach after taking over for Butch Davis, Helfrich inherited a lot of great talent, led by the man who became Oregon's first Heisman Trophy winner, Marcus Mariota.  Of course, Helfrich got all the praises for leading Oregon to the first National Championship in the playoff era, with the perfection of Marcus Mariota leading the way, but it's easy to win when you have a player perfectly built for a great offense.  It's maintaining that success that cost Helfrich, exemplified by their defensive woes.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">

		<h4>Simpler times with Rich Brooks</h4>
</div>

<p>Even in their prime, Oregon was not an elite defensive team, but their offense made up for the defensive woes the Ducks faced. Things were decent with Nick Alliotti as their defensive coordinator, who was at least able to make the best of it, but after he retired, it went downhill. Again, Oregon kept it in family by promoting Don Pellum from Linebackers coach. But after Marcus Mariota left, the Ducks struggled on defense, and their offense couldn't sustain consistency, which was explained perfectly in the Alamo Bowl, where the Ducks blew a 31-0 halftime lead after losing talented QB Vernon Adams to injury to lose the game 34-31, where the team had to hold on for dear life and couldn't. Pellum was demoted and in came Brady Hoke, the former Michigan coach serving as a coordinator for the first time. Unfortunately, a lack of talent combined with a defensive scheme change helped led the Ducks to their worst season since 1991.  That was not an issue with Chip but more on Helfrich.</p>
	<p>It's easy to see why Mark Helfrich was fired.  He couldn't grow the program like Chip Kelly had.  The defensive players they brought in weren't as good as advertised and their highly-rated QB recruits didn't pan out, leading to using talented transfers Vernon Adams and Dakota Prukop to come along.  For the first time since Mariota left, the Ducks appear to have the QB of the future in Justin Herbert, who showed lots of potential as a true freshman, but with a porous defense and young offensive line, the Ducks couldn't overcome the lousy defense to win.  And like Mariota, Justin Herbert is a diamond in the rough, from Sheldon High School and not highly recruited.  Unfortunately, the Ducks weren't lucky like that on the defensive side.  In the end, that's what cost Helfrich the job. Would I given Helfrich one more chance?  Sure I would’ve.  Is it surprising the Ducks didn't?  Of course not.  The cracks were showing, and unfortunately, they aren’t likely to get better now.  So where does Oregon go from here?</p>
	<p>The Ducks are in uncharted territory now. The basketball team dealt with this when Ernie Kent got fired after a long run. The Ducks thought they could throw money at big-time coaches, but that failed miserably and they were laughed at when they finally made their decision to hire Creighton head coach Dana Altman. Fortunately, the Ducks were lucky to get him, as he’s done a great job with the basketball squad. So with that in mind, Oregon shouldn’t have too high of expectations with their coaching search. Les Miles? Highly unlikely to come out west. Lane Kiffin? I’d be embarrassed to give him another coaching opportunity. PJ Fleck from Western Michigan? Perhaps but I don’t see it happening. Chip Kelly? That’s a pipe dream. Will they keep their offense the same? Will they bring someone with defensive skills? One things for sure, there are rough waters upon the horizon and it’s not going to get fixed overnight.</p>
