<p> It's 'I Hate USC' week as the Oregon Ducks head down to SoCal for the first time since 2012.  I really hate USC, and I make it no secret, but you can read all about that <a href="http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2015/11/21/usc-my-anti-christ">here</a>.  But there are more important things than bashing all things USC.  The Gophers played Purdue and with the official playoff rankings out, the chase really begins.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/western-michigan.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Western Michigan" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Western Michigan QB Zach Terrell</h4>
</div>

    <p>The Gophers hosted Purdue, a team that's been at the bottom of the pole the past few years but has nothing to lose.  Their style of play, more pass-heavy than the traditional Big Ten team makes Purdue a potentially sneaky team.  And in the first half, Purdue kept it close, taking the lead just before the half after a dumb interception from Mitch Leidner.  But the second half was a different story, as Rodney Smith led the way on the ground and the Gophers defense took over, winning 44-31.  Shannon Brooks was injured and not much is known why, or for how long.  They need him back to complement Rodney Smith, as the schedule gets tougher for the last three games: Nebraska, Northwestern and rival Wisconsin.  The Gophers have won four straight and have surpassed their win total last year, but the meat of their schedule is now.</p>
    <p>That leads into the game against the Cheaters.  Of course, Oregon hasn't been themselves this year and their defense is young and broken.  But perhaps an upset is in the books.  Unfortunately, that was not the case as the Cheaters won 45-20.  Not much to say here, but we can solace in the fact that the Cheaters are still overrated and unworthy of the hype.  They were blown out by Alabama, blown out by Stanford, and most importantly, lost a close game to Utah, the latter which will probably keep them out of the Pac-12 title game.  So the Cheaters are still an overrated piece of crap.  Next up for Oregon, the only other dominant team in the Pac-12 North up until this year; Stanford.</p>
    <p>The official College Football Playoff Rankings have begun, and surprise surprise, Texas A&amp;M finds itself ranked ahead of Washington.  First ranking aside, another sign of SEC-bias.  But obviously, it's the final ranking that matters.  But they won't be ranked fourth in the next poll, they lost to Mississippi State, losing their QB Trevor Knight in the process.  That's what we call a big jinx.  Also of note is Clemson jumping ahead of Michigan.  With wins against Louisville and Florida State, Clemson has definitely had a tougher schedule to this point.  As Baylor, Texas A&amp;M and Nebraska lost, we can eliminate them.  That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Ohio State, Louisville, Auburn, Wisconsin and Oklahoma.  The final three teams have been added to the list but the former six are the best shots at this point.</p>

		<h4>Proof that kindness in humanity still exists, courtesy of Ohio State.</h4>
</div>    
    <p>Baylor was completely obliterated against TCU.  Thank god, I've never liked Baylor and their imitation high speed offense.  And unlike Oregon, who made two national title games this decade, Baylor couldn't win the big game. Goodbye Baylor.  --- Washington State is now ranked and won big against Arizona, 69-7.  Who knows how high they'd be ranked if not for their loss to Eastern Washington.  But much kudos to them.  And they're still unbeaten in conference play.  If they keep up the pace, they could finally get the ESPN GameDay crew to come to Pullman, as the Apple Cup is at Pullman this year. --- I've always enjoyed the smaller schools, so I got my eye on Western Michigan, as the only unbeaten team left amongst the non-major conference schools.  They are clearly the second best team in the state of Michigan, as Michigan State lost again to Illinois.  How did the Spartans fall so far off the face of the planet?  But Western Michigan, who beat Northwestern in the first game of the season and beat Illinois as well, two more Big Ten opponents than Michigan State has beaten, has a shot to finish unbeaten.  We'll see what happens. --- Hearing about the death of Nebraska punter Sam Foltz and all the tributes their opponents have given them reminds me of how great humanity can be.  Mike Riley is absolutely the right coach for Nebraska and despite his mistakes in the past, is man enough to admit his errors and make things right. It should be noted that this was the only nice thing Ohio State did against Nebraska; they blew them out of the water, 62-3. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Clemson</li>
<li>Washington</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Louisville</li>
<li>Wisconsin</li>
<li>Auburn (NR)</li>
<li>Penn State (NR)</li>
<li>Oklahoma (NR)</li>

</ol>
