<p> The season's almost over, and there's no margin for error when it comes to finishing the season strong and ending the year on a positive note.  Oregon's not going to make a bowl, but they have two games left to try to pick up the pieces and finish the year on a positive note.  For Mark Helfrich, that could make the difference between remaining as head coach or not.  For the Golden Gophers, seven wins is not enough, eight would be better.  And the playoff race is down to the final stretch, and those who lose will face elimination.</p>

		<h4>By the slimest of margins, Darren Carrington's touchdown pushed Oregon to victory</h4>
</div>

    <p>Oregon faced off against Utah, bringing back memories of their last trip to Salt Lake City two years ago, memorable for two reasons.  First was the ridiculous and infamous Kaelin Clay fumble just BEFORE he crossed the goal line, which Oregon recovered and ran a convoy to a touchdown while Utah was celebrating their 'touchdown.'  That is something I'll never forget.  Second was the unfortunate injury to Pharaoh Brown, who returns to Salt Lake City for the first time since.  Unfortunately, Oregon has had a bad season, while Utah is ranked #12 and has an outside shot of winning the Pac-12 title.  But there's a reason they play the game, and Oregon had its best defensive performance of the year, playing with their hearts, as they managed to hold Utah to just 28 points.  And needing something to go their way, Justin Herbert completed an improbable pass to Darren Carrington, who just managed to get his foot inbounds for an acrobatic catch to get the improbable win, a stunner to say the least.  Perhaps this will get Mark Helfrich one more chance, which I believe he deserves.  Next week is Oregon's last game of the season, but it's always an entertaining matchup when it's the Civil War.</p>
    <p>It's Senior Day for Minnesota, and on a chilly November afternoon, its their last home game of the year against the most bizarre of teams, Northwestern.  The Wildcats started the year on an awful note, losing to Western Michigan and Illinois State, but recovered in Big Ten play, beating Iowa.  Of course, this means it will be Mitch Leidner's last home game for the Gophers.  Leidner has been a decent quarterback, but too much inconsistency in the passing game kept Leidner from reaching the next level.  Fortunately, Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks figure to be back next year (assuming neither one goes to the NFL...), and they have been the bread and butter for the Gophers this year, along with their defense.  As for Northwestern, their offense never got comfortable against Minnesota's pressure, with multiple sacks and turnovers.  The Gophers took a while to get their offense going (aside from a perfect opening drive) as Mitch Leidner finally threw a touchdown pass (his first in seven weeks).  The Gophers put together a good performance against Northwestern, and have reached eight wins for the season.  They're not going to make it to the Big Ten title game, but Minnesota has played better this year than last (although their schedule this season was far easier than last year's gauntlet).  The final game of the regular season, a battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe, as I would love to see the Gophers win it just once.</p>
    <p>Thursday night proved to be big for the playoff race, as Louisville got blown out by Houston, probably ending their hopes.  It's hard to say what the race would've been like had Houston not lost to Navy and (especially) SMU, with two big wins against Oklahoma and now Louisville.  Clemson is heading to the ACC Title game against whoever wins the ACC's other division (Virginia Tech?), so a win in the ACC title game would put them back in the playoffs.  Ohio State barely got by Michigan State, 17-16, and Michigan needed a good fourth quarter to put Indiana away, but next week the Wolverines and Buckeyes face off in what could determine who wins the Big Ten.  But Penn State still has a shot at crashing that party.  Watch out... That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Ohio State, Michigan, Clemson, Washington, Wisconsin, Penn State and Oklahoma.  Penn State could make it to the Big Ten title game over both Ohio State and Michigan (assuming they beat Michigan State) if Ohio State beats Michigan.  Watch out...</p>

		<h4>55 years young walk-on Joe Thomas Sr. getting hoisted by his young teammates</h4>
</div>    
    <p>South Carolina State made history today as 55-years-young Joe Thomas Sr. (whose son plays for the Green Bay Packers), became the oldest player to play in a Division I college football game.  Proof that it's never too late to play.  Kudos for Joe Thomas Sr. --- At the beginning of the season, who would've thought that Washington State vs. Colorado could both be playing with the Pac-12 championship on the line?  Colorado has been in the dumps for a while but has finally found a way out, while Washington State finally found a defense as good as its Air Raid offense.  Kudos for both of them, but more for Colorado, who won 38-24.  Colorado is a win away from making the Pac-12 Title game.  As for Mike Leach, I still don't like him though he's good at what he does. --- Remember when Texas was ranked in the Top Ten earlier this year after beating Notre Dame?  How times have changed.  Notre Dame was not very good, and now that Texas just lost today to Kansas (for the first time since 1938), there's a lot of reasons to be upset in Texas.  Word around town is that they really want to fire Charlie Strong.  Good coach with values, but Texas has ridiculously high standards, he was never going to succeed with all the pressure. ---  LSU running back Leonard Fournette wasn't supposed to play today against Florida due to injury, but after a brawl before the game, he asked to be put in.  Toughness aside, it's probably not the best idea to be inspired by a feud. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Clemson(+1)</li>
<li>Wisconsin(+1)</li>
<li>Washington(+1)</li>
<li>Oklahoma(+1)</li>
<li>Penn State(+1)</li>
<li>Oklahoma State(+1)</li>
<li>Colorado (NR)</li>
</ol>
