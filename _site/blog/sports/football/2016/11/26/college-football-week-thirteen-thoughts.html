<p> It's officially rivalry week, where the Civil War and the Battle for Paul Bunyan's Axe is in full effect, along with a slew of other important games, including Michigan-Ohio State, Colorado-Utah and Alabama-Auburn.  If you're not ready for college football this week, then you shouldn't be watching football at all.  Conference champion bids on the line today in an exciting week for college football.</p>

</div>

    <p>I have seen both sides of college football rivalries.  On the one hand, Oregon hasn't lost the Civil War since 2007, throughly dominating the Beavers in the process.  But I know what it's like to be the Beavers, as Minnesota hasn't won Paul Bunyan's Axe since 2003, as Wisconsin has clearly dominated the series.  So safe to say, I know both the good and the bad in rivalry games.  Will this be the year the Gophers chop down the goal post with the Axe, something I've never seen before?  Will Oregon maintain its dominance against Oregon State, with this being their last game in an otherwise disappointing season?</p>
    <p>Playing against the Big West champion Wisconsin wasn't going to be easy by any means, and Minnesota, time and time again, while playing against competitive teams, start off well enough but lose steam in the second half.  And this is exactly what happened to the Gophers today.  Mitch Leidner looked brilliant in the first half, his best performance of the season, leading the Gophers to a 17-7 lead.  The second half, not so much, as Mitch Leidner ended up throwing four interceptions in a 31-17 loss (again) to Wisconsin.  Pretty much what I expected from Mitch Leidner and the Gophers.  The regular season's over; they finished 8-4, which is exactly what I predicted from them, but the Big Ten West was stronger than expected, which got them in fourth place.</p>
    <p>The Civil War, this year featuring two losing teams, had nothing but pride on the line.  Oregon came in as the favorite by 3, but on the road against an Oregon State team that can run the ball consistently, Oregon had their hands full with Ryan Nall at the helm, who had his coming out party against the Ducks last year.  And scoring four touchdowns, the Beavers finally beat Oregon in the Civil War.  A perfect ending to a bad season from the Ducks, who I thought would still be a winning team at 9-3, but their defense was far worse than advertised.  Oregon's season is over, and now for the big question, will Mark Helfrich still be the head coach?</p>
    <p>The Big Game for the playoff hunt was of course, Michigan at Ohio State, and the game matched the hype, as the two teams went back and forth, and for the first time in the series, the game went into overtime.  But Ohio State ended up on top, winning 30-27 in double OT.  But with Ohio State's win, now comes the big question?  Does Ohio State, with just one loss to Penn State, get into the playoffs with Penn State, not Ohio State, winning the Big Ten East by virtue of giving the Buckeyes their only loss?  And if so, does the Big Ten title winner also make it to the Playoffs?  Wisconsin and Penn State are both ranked in the top 8 right now and have only two losses on the year.  Alabama and Clemson are locks to return assuming they win their conference champion, and Washington, should they win the Pac-12 title, would also have only one loss.  I would have to believe at this point that the Big Ten will have two teams.  Washington, unfortunately, didn't play a strong schedule, and that will cost them (assuming they win the Pac-12 title) along with the good old East Coast Bias.  Had they beaten USC, it would be a different story.  This also means Oklahoma is out of the race. That leaves the following teams: Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson, Washington, Wisconsin and Penn State.</p>

		<h4>Defenses need not apply with Pitt vs. Syracuse</h4>
</div>    
    <p>As previously suspected, Texas really wanted Charlie Strong fired and they did.  Record aside, he never had a chance to succeed at Texas.  What a shame.  As for the Texas Longhorns, Houston head coach Tom Herman has agreed to take over.  A very logical choice for Texas. --- Speaking of coaching vacancies, Ed Orgeron was promoted as head coach for LSU, absolutely the right decision for LSU.  USC made a mistake choosing Steve Sarkisian over then interim Ed Orgeron, and he's a fighter, which LSU clearly proved after firing Les Miles. --- Pittsburgh and Syracuse had an extreme shoot-out, with Pitt winning 76-61, setting a record for the most points in a game between two teams.  Speaking of Pitt, they've beaten two of the six teams still with a shot at the playoffs, Clemson and Penn State.  --- Navy also reached to 70 point club today, with a 75-31 win over SMU. --- Now that the regular season's over, my pick for the Heisman is still Louisville QB Lamar Jackson, despite Louisville's late season slump; they lost to instate rival Kentucky 41-38.  I can't think of anyone else more deserving.  --- Congrats to Colorado, who went from winning just five games the past three years to winning the Pac-12 South with a 10-2 regular season record.  Remarkable turnaround from a program who really needed it.  Mike MacIntyre deserves to be the national coach of the year for this stunning turnaround.  And they kept USC out of the Pac-12 title game.  A Double Winner in my book. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Clemson (+1)</li>
<li>Wisconsin (+1)</li>
<li>Washington (+1)</li>
<li>Michigan (-3)</li>
<li>Penn State (+1)</li>
<li>Colorado (+2)</li>
<li>Oklahoma (-1)</li>
<li>Oklahoma State (NR)</li>
</ol>
