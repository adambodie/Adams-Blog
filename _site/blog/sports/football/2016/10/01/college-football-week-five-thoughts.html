<p> Week Five has plenty of great matchups, with three top ten conference battles for the first time: Stanford at Washington on Friday, Wisconsin at Michigan and Louisville at Clemson.  Meanwhile, it's the battle for the Governor's Victory Bell for Minnesota as they went to Penn State, while Oregon, after a demoralizing loss last week, head to Washington State, where they hope to avoid last years dysentery affected loss to Washington State</p>

		<h4>What in the heck did they feed Joey Julius?</h4>
</div>

    <p>The first game I went to at the University of Minnesota was a matchup against Penn State at the old Metrodome.  A good game aside, though Penn State won 28-27 thanks to a missed PAT from the Gophers.  Ten years later, the two programs have changed dramatically.  Minnesota was mired in bored mediocrity under Glen Mason, while Penn State had legendary coach Joe Paterno on the sideline.  Their program obviously crashed over the Jerry Sandusky scandal, while Minnesota got a burst of energy from Jerry Kill, who laid the foundation for Tracy Claeys.  This game had the signs of a close matchup, and it did not disappoint.  One thing that stands out for Penn State is their ridiculously large placekicker Joey Julius, who looks and tackles like a nose tackle but with kicking ability.  He laid some monster hits in previous games.  But Gopher LB Jaylen Waters delivered a cheap shot on him, getting ejected.  Pretty stupid.  On the flip side, the Gophers have the tallest  player in college football, 6-10 Tight End Nate Wozniak.  Also, I didn't realize Antoine Winfield Jr. was a cornerback, his dad was a great NFL cornerback.  But for the Gophers, their rushing game was a good as advertised, with Rodney Smith and Shannon Brooks as a great 1-2 punch.  But Penn State, with homecourt advantage, squeaked out an overtime victory 29-26.  The Gophers had their chances, but Penn State made some big plays in the second half to end up with the victory.  Chances are, the Gophers would've won that game at home, but they'll need to improve next week as they host the suddenly struggling Iowa Hawkeyes next week at home for the battle of the Floyd of Rosedale.</p>

        <h4>The Cougs are right, Oregon has died of Dysentery</h4>
    </div>
    <p>As for the Oregon Ducks, it's clear that their defense is completely broken, and their offense can't keep up.  Washington State loves to throw the ball, and they did plenty of that against the Ducks, but what was surprising was that they managed to rush for six touchdowns with 280 yards on the ground.  Oregon clearly can't stop the run, and they're not going to do any better until they figure out a way to do so.  Clearly, Brady Hoke hasn't improved our defense at all, but the Ducks also lack the depth and personnel, so it's unfair to say whether Hoke has failed since he's not even into his first season.  Oregon's in a crisis, it's been a while, but this is not going to be Oregon's year, unless they drastically improve their defense.  Next week they play Washington, who've they haven't lost to in 12 years, but Washington will come into Autzen Stadium as a favorite for the first time in years.  Oregon will need a huge upset to keep that streak alive.</p>

    		<h4>Nate Wozniak is HUGE!</h4>

    <p>I didn't think if was possible, but the Huckin' Fuskies appear to be legit, they crushed Stanford.  Good lord!  Who'd of thunk that Steve Sarkisian leaving would be the best thing to happen to them.  Not only did they get a great coach in Chris Petersen, but they got rid of a drunk.  How well did he do at USC? --- Baylor should be ashamed of themselves.  Their new head coach Jim Grobe brought rape survivor Brenda Tracy to speak to them, and while she said the players were engaged, an assistant questioned her appearance and made her feel unwanted.  How disgusting!  They barely beat Iowa State 45-42.  That school is messed up, only interesting in winning.  You wonder why Penn State got in the position they did. --- Last week, I mentioned about Les Miles' poor clock management.  The next day, he was fired.  They should've fired him in the offseason when they wanted to.  His act got old pretty quick.  In the interim is Ed Orgeron, whom USC made a big mistake not keeping, hiring Steve Sarkisian instead.  How well did that work out for USC? --- What the heck is going on with Northwestern?  They've lost games to Western Michigan and Illinois State, but managed to beat Iowa.  Pretty perplexing to say the least. --- Five weeks into the season, and two of my picks for the playoffs already have two losses.  Florida State got embarrassed by Louisville and just lost today at home to North Carolina.  That's not national championship material.  Oklahoma's lost twice as well, but on the road to Houston and Ohio State.  They still have a shot, but have to run the table.  Pretty tough. Florida State, on the other hand, has two conference losses already.  They're out.  ---  Tennessee might be the most entertaining team to watch, as they've had to make comebacks in four of their five games this season to win, including three halftime deficits (one against Appalachian State!), and the other game against Ohio was a close one as well.  Against Georgia today, Tennessee completed a hail mary to win the game.  Safe to say, that type of grit will help them in the long run, especially for their next two games: Texas A&amp;M and Alabama.  Those will be tough.  --- Indiana finally beat Michigan State in OT, 24-21.  The Hoosiers have come a long way, and they won with defense, a far cry from their high-scoring/no-defense past.  Props to the Hoosiers.  --- With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Michigan (+1)</li>
<li>Clemson (+1)</li>
<li>Louisville (-2)</li>
<li>Houston (+1)</li>
<li>Texas A&amp;M (+1)</li>
<li>Washington (+2)</li>
<li>Tennessee (NR)</li>
<li>Miami (NR)</li>
</ol>
