<p> Week Six for me is Rivalry Week Part 1.  Minnesota hosted Iowa for the Floyd of Rosedale and Oregon hosted Washington, winning twelve in a row against them but looking far worse now than they have at ay time in those twelve years.  As for the the rest of the games, another entertaining variety of match-ups.</p>

		<h4>My proudest moment watching the Gophers at the Metrodome, carrying off Floyd of Rosedale</h4>
</div>

    <p>I went to four games while I was at the University of Minnesota, and the last game against Iowa was the best game of the bunch.  They beat a rival and won a trophy.  So it went without saying that Minnesota really needed a win against Iowa, to prove their legitimacy as possible Big Ten contenders.  Unfortunately, while their defense looked strong, their offense sputtered and could only muster up 7 points, losing to Iowa 14-7 after an Iowa touchdown late in the fourth quarter put them up ahead for good.  While Minnesota has the running backs, they still lack consistency in the passing game.  A tough loss to swallow, but Iowa's defense is just as good, a good old classic Big Ten Slugfest.  Next week for Minnesota: a road trip to Maryland, Minnesota's first game against Maryland since they joined the Big Ten.  The last (and only) time they've met was in 1977.</p>

        <h4>Webfoots, Ducks, whatever you want to call them, they can't defend.</h4>
    </div>
    <p>The last time Oregon lost to Washington, I was a freshman at the U of O.  I remember watching the game on TV.  Hard to believe Oregon would end up winning the next twelve games.  But this year, Washington enters the game ranked #5 and statistically with the best defense in the country.  Oregon, on the other hand, couldn't stop a chair from scoring.  Wearing their Webfoots jerseys to honor the ancient days, Oregon made a surprising change at Quarterback starting true freshman Justin Herbert.  For the first time in a long time, Oregon looked completely overmatched and likely to get blown out.  And they were blown out, just as everyone figured, final score 70-21.  And just like that, the streak is over.  Oregon gets a much needed week off, but it doesn't look any easier as they face Davis Webb and the high-flying Cal offense.  It's not going to get any easier for the Ducks and with their defense as horrific as it's looked, this will not turn out well.  This may be the beginning of the end for Mark Helfrich.  I questioned how effective he'd be without Marcus Mariota leading the way and it hasn't been particularly pretty at times.  Oregon fans will be pissed, and should be.</p>

    		<h4>Thoughts to those affected by Hurricane Matthew, even in Raleigh the rain looks horrific.</h4>
        </div>
    <p>It's tough to finish a season undefeated, no matter what conference you play in.  Houston, having beaten (a now overrated) Oklahoma at home, lost to high-scoring Navy 46-40.  Their slim chance to make the Playoffs unfortunately is over.  But they can still make a Big Five bowl game. --- Tennessee might be the most entertaining team in the country.  Every game they've played in this season has seen them make a big comeback, and against Texas A&amp;M they came back from a 28-7 deficit.  Volunteers never say die.  But desite the comeback and leading the game into OT, Texas A&amp;M won 45-38.  Gotta give the Vols credit for fighting back.  --- Who would've thought that when Colorado played USC, that the one ranked team would actually be Colorado.  But USC ended up winning 21-17.  What a shame.  --- Hurricane Matthew had a big impact on some of the games in that area.  It postponed LSU-Florida (which neither team has a shared open game to reschedule it, stay turned), and drenched games in the Carolinas.  I saw the rain on a clip of the Notre Dame-NC State game, it looked nasty.  --- Another nasty hit on Penn State kicker Joey Julius.  I didn't realize he had an eating problem.  For that, I apologize for my previous caption on him.  --- Michigan beat Rutgers 78-0.  Rutgers lost to Ohio State 58-0 last week.  Why are they in the Big Ten again? --- Miami fans started throwing litter all over the field after a penalty call went against them.  Only Miami, right?  ---  With that said, here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Ohio State</li>
<li>Clemson(+1)</li>
<li>Michigan (-1)</li>
<li>Louisville</li>
<li>Washington (+2)</li>
<li>Texas A&amp;M</li>
<li>Wisconsin (NR)</li>
<li>Nebraska (NR)</li>
<li>Baylor (NR)</li>
</ol>
