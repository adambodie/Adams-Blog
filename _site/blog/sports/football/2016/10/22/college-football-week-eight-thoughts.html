<p> Week Eight is unofficially Homecoming Week.  For Minnesota, it's their official Homecoming game against Rutgers, their first matchup ever.  For Oregon, it's a painful reminder of how far they've truly fallen against another high powered offensive team in Cal.  That game was played yesterday.  As we reach Week 8, a closer picture starts for determining the four playoff teams.  I'll talk more about that later.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>It's crazy every one-handed grab will be compared to OBJ.</h4>
</div>

    <p>Oregon faced off against Cal on Friday night mired in a losing streak.  Unfortunately, their defense still sucks tremendously.  On the plus side, Justin Herbert looks legit, bring the Ducks back from a 20 point deficit to force overtime, throwing for six touchdowns.  But his one interception sealed the game in double OT, as Cal won a wild-west shootout 52-49.  Now the Ducks are on their longest losing streak since 1996.  How times have changed.  The Ducks were mired in mediocrity before that yet Rich Brooks remained the coach for 17 years, building a legacy.  But that legacy may have reached its end, as the Ducks are now a different team and have bigger goals in mind.  Mark Helfrich, as good as a man he is, probably needs a miracle to keep his job.  The rest of the Ducks schedule looks daunting: Arizona State, USC, Stanford, Utah and Oregon State, all teams that can run the ball quite well.  Something Oregon clearly can't stop.  Chances are, should Helfrich be fired, they will look outside for a coach.  Perhaps Chip Kelly would come back, as his NFL career has predictably turned out to be disappointing, and his 49ers look terrible.  But we'll see what happens there.  Until then, Duck fans everywhere should start counting down to basketball season.  At least the basketball team looks strong and can play defense.</p>
    <p>Minnesota, meanwhile, played its first game against Rutgers.  The good news for them is that Mitch Leidner returned after suffering a concussion two weeks ago against Iowa.  A surprise as he was declared out just two days ago.  Even better news, Rutgers is just plain awful.  The worst team in the Big Ten and probably the worst team of all the major conference teams.  Unfortunately for Minnesota, after a great game in Maryland, their performance against Rutgers was a letdown.  Although they won 34-32, Minnesota needed a last second field goal to win a game that they should've easily won.  They were favored by 17 points and jumped to a 21-3 lead, but Rutgers, who entered the game with just 14 points in the season against Big Ten foes, scored 32 and took the lead late in the fourth quarter.  Again, it was Mitch Leidner and the passing game that struggled.  They'll need to play better next week when they visit Illinois.</p>
    <p>As the playoff race begins, we have a clear top team: Alabama.  They look pretty unstoppable at this point, and appear to be a lock to defend their title.  But anything can happen, as Ohio State was shocked by Penn State, who came back from a 21-7 decifit to win 24-21.  Ohio State is still in the playoff hunt, as a matchup with Michigan still looms with the Big Ten East (and a trip to the Big Ten title game) on the line.  The Big XII needs a miracle to get back in the playoffs, as the only unbeatens team left in the conference are Baylor, currently ranked 9th, and West Virginia, whose currently ranked 12th.  The chances of them running the table are low, so most likely, the Big XII is out.  Washington has a good shot of finishing unbeaten, and is the only Pac-12 team that can bring the conference back after missing the playoffs last season.  The ACC is a bit of a scramble between Clemson and Louisville.  Clemson beat Lousiville in a close matchup, but they still have to face Florida State, who can play spoiler and create a three-way tie between the three, all in the same division of the ACC.  If either Clemson or Washington lose a game, that would open up a spot for both Michigan and Ohio State.  At this point, the following teams are still alive: Alabama, Ohio State, Michigan, Clemson, Texas A&amp;M, Louisville, Nebraska, Baylor, West Virginia, and Florida.  At the end of the day, anything can happen between now and December.  After all, the Chicago Cubs clinched their first World Series appearance since 1945 and are four wins away from their first title since 1908.</p>
    <p>Northwestern continues to be the most confusing team in the country.  They lost to Western Michigan, though they are undefeated, so that's a plus for them, and even worse, lost to Illinois State.  But they have rebounded, beating Iowa among other teams.  And much credit to Safety Kyle Queiro, who completed an OBJ like one-handed interception. --- Congrats to the Colorado Buffaloes, who have now won six games this year and clinched a bowl berth.  They could win the Pac-12 South with the talent they have.  Unfortunately, Oregon has replaced them in the gutter for the time being.  Not only did Washington beat both Oregon and Stanford (convincingly), Colorado has as well.  Mike McIntyre definitely belongs in the running for Coach of the Year. --- Utah running back Joseph Williams rushed for 332 yards against UCLA today.  Combined with Arizona State running back Kalen Ballage's seven rushing touchdown (eight overall) against Texas Tech earlier in the season equals two reasons Oregon is not going to get better any time soon.  Yikes!--- The Heisman race this year is Louisville QB Lamar Jackson's to lose.  He struck the Heisman pose today against NC State.  --- Oklahoma and Texas Tech combined for 1,708 yards, setting a new record.  That's a lot of yards.  Seven records were broken in that game. --- With that said, so here are my picks for Top Ten:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alabama</li>
<li>Michigan (+1)</li>
<li>Clemson (+1)</li>
<li>Washington (+1)</li>
<li>Ohio State (-3)</li>
<li>Louisville</li>
<li>Nebraska (+1)</li>
<li>Wisconsin (+1)</li>
<li>Baylor (+1)</li>
<li>Texas A&amp;M (-3)</li>
</ol>
