<p>Two weeks ago, Jerry Kill, the football coach of the Gophers, retired due to health concerns.  It seemed as if Minnesota would plummet to mediocrity yet again.  But despite the loss of Kill, the program made leaps and bounds in terms of success, fan appreciation and continuity while he was there.  Fanfare was much higher than it was when I went there in 2006, with JerrySota becoming a common phrase for Gopher fans.  They had two choices: Keep things the way it was and retain trusty defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys as its coach, or go in a different direction.  Choosing continuity over uncertainty, Minnesota made the right choice to keep Claeys as Head Coach.</p>

	<h4>Tracy Claeys on the sidelines.</h4>
</div>


<p>To understand what Jerry Kill meant for the program and how he can continue to affect the program, I'd like to take this time to compare the University of Minnesota, my alma mater, with the University of Oregon, where I spent three years at before transferring.  Much like Minnesota, Oregon has kept virtually the same coaching staff since the legendary Rich Brooks became the coach in 1977.  When he took over, Oregon was just another program.  No tradition, no success, not like it is today.  But he built the program from the ground up, and finally, in 1994, after years of gently scratching the surface, Oregon won its first conference title outright in 100 years and made the Rose Bowl for only the second time in 100 years.  During that time, Rich Brooks kept the same coordinators and assistants around, many of whom are still there today.  It was in this factor that Rich Brooks laid a foundation for years to come.  The same foundation Jerry Kill had in all of his coaching stops.  He didn't stay in one place too long, but yet he kept the same staff everywhere he went, with the same results (winning more than before).</p>
<p>The following years after Rich Brooks left Oregon proved to be highly successful.  After the Rose Bowl in 1995, Rich Brooks became a coaching commodity and left for the NFL, where the coached the St. Louis Rams for two seasons.  While he wasn't successful in the NFL, Oregon's success was only beginning.  Did Oregon hire an outside sexy candidate to take over?  Nope, they kept it in the family and made offensive coordinator Mike Bellotti the coach.  And Oregon only got better with Bellotti at the helm.  Though Oregon only won two conference titles in the fourteen years there, he became the winningest coach in history, and led the Ducks to twelve bowl appearances, including a breakthrough 2001 season which Oregon finished ranked #2 in the Nation after a convincing Fiesta Bowl win.  And much like Brooks before him, Bellotti liked to keep his assistants in house and kept virtually the same staff.  Bellotti did reach outside to find a new offensive coordinator in 2007, but instead of finding the big name, he went small and found a relatively unknown offensive coordinator at the University of New Hampshire by the name of Chip Kelly, whose potent offense turned Oregon into a National name.  Two years later, Chip Kelly became the head coach after Bellotti retired.</p>
<p>Oregon became title contenders with Kelly, reaching BCS bowl games in all four years he was there, played for a National Championship game, and got big time players to join, including Marcus Mariota, who just last year became Oregon's first Heisman Trophy Winner.  And during all this time, Oregon still had coaches left over from Rich Brooks, whose name bears the field at Autzen Stadium.  Later, when Chip Kelly left for the NFL, he turned to his offensive coordinator, Mark Helfrich to be the head coach.  No sexy names, just Oregon Duck lifers, guys who knew the program, worked with the program, and had tradition with the program.</p>
<p>This is exactly the type of groundwork Minnesota needs.  Jerry Kill preached this type of tradition, loyalty and continuity by keeping the same staff with him for the twenty one years he coached at various schools.  And who better for Minnesota than Tracy Claeys, who filled in for Kill in 2013 when he took a leave of absence to treat his health problems.  Will Claeys be a great coach?  Only time will tell.  But one thing is for sure, Minnesota is on the right track.  Recruits who wanted to play for Jerry Kill were excited that Claeys would take over, knowing that tradition would stay there.    It's much preferred than what Minnesota previously had.  Tim Brewster, a coach with no prior experience, with three different offensive and defensive coordinators in four years, each with a completely different style that didn't fit the players at all.  Glen Mason, who did little to challenge the Gophers, getting bowl eligible due to cupcake non-conference games while routinely getting beat by the big teams.  This is what happens when you don't have any continuity.  The Gophers don't need the home-run hire.  They're not going to get one.  They don't need the hot coach at the moment.  Remember when the Gophers had the rumors with Al Golden, the hot and upcoming coach at Temple?  How did that one work out for Miami, who hired him in 2011 and fired him last month after a 58-0 loss to Clemson?  That's why Tracy Claeys should be the head coach.  The tradition's there, it just needs to grow.</p>
