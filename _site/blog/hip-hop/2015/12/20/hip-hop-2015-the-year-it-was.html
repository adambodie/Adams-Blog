    <div class="article">
<p>Another year has gone by, and for an avid hip-hop fan like myself, I can sum up the year in general as mediocre.  While Kendrick Lamar continued his onslaught as the most talented rapper at the moment (with apologies to legends like Eminem or Nas, who were relatively quiet this year), many of the highly regarded albums in the world of popular rap were filled with syrupy R&amp;B beats and ridiculous R&amp;B singing in their raps (here's looking at you Fetty Wap).  While there were plenty of rappers with rap albums who actually rap, the most attention still ends up with Drake, whose corny beats, pointless beefs and a collaboration with equally lame rapper Future dominated the news.</p>




<p>The biggest surprise of 2015 of course came in August, when Dr. Dre finally released his follow-up to his 2001 album many years ago.  No, it wasn't Detox, but rather, Compton, an album inspired by the N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton.  But while this was a great surprise, most of the headlines revolved around the incredibly lame beef between Drake and Meek Mill.  Gone are the days of rappers actually rapping their verses, now we're forced to hear stupid twitter rants and uninspired battle raps.  Clearly the whole thing was a publicity stunt by Meek Mill to promote his album.  Too bad Meek Mill has never been much of a lyricist.  But I digress.</p>

<p>My favorite hip-hop moment of the year came from perhaps the oddest thing ever to happen to hip-hop.  Run the Jewels, once the most unlikely group, now the best group out right now, released their remix album 'Meow the Jewels,' an odd yet entertaining remix of their Run the Jewels 2 album, featuring nothing but cat sounds.  What started off as a joke became a reality thanks to the plethora of producers interested in making it, and the ensuing fan funded drive to release the album (all proceeds went to charity).  Where else can you find Snoop Dogg singing the Meow Mix song on an album so humorously or Just Blaze acting hysterically over a cat invasion but Meow the Jewels.</p>

<p>Though many popular rappers on the radio suck and can't make a good song, there is hope for hip-hop.  One rapper I discovered this year that impressed me is Mick Jenkins, a young rapper out of Chicago whose mixtape The Water[s] (released last year) was well done and thought out.  A better example of Chance the Rapper (who also comes from the same collective of new rappers from Chicago), Mick Jenkins jazzy production and lyrics about water impressed me.  With lyrics like 'Water more important than the gold / People for the gold / Everybody do it for the gold / People save your souls,' Mick cleverly uses water as a metaphor, which he does throughout the project.  He also released Wave[s] this year, a follow up with similar themes, jazzy production and lyrical talents.</p>



<p>Another rapper I discovered is the young musician Raury, who blends all kinds of music, from rap, rock, folk, soul, etc.  I first heard him featured on the excellent Joey Bada$$ song Escape 120, but later listened to his debut project 'Indigo Child,' which finds Raury all over the place, somewhat similar to Andre 3000.  God's Whisper was easily one of my favorite tracks of the year, and the sequel Devil's Whisper (off his recently released debut All We Need, which I haven't fully checked out yet) is just as impressive.</p>

<p>As I look back at 2015, I realize how more distant I am from mainstream music.  One way I can tell is through XXL's Freshmen Edition, a list of 10 or so rappers they believe are going to be the 'next hot thing.'  The list has degraded in quality since 2010, and this year's list was mostly awful: Vince Staples, Goldlink, Raury, Dej Loaf, Fetty Wap, K Camp, Shy Glizzy, Tink, OG Maco and 'The Peoples Champ', Kidd Kidd.  Here's my opinion on each</p>

<p>Vince Staples: A young street smart kid from LA, the only one on the list I had extensive knowledge of prior to this list coming out.  Not a bad lyricist, enjoyed some of his mixtape tracks, but couldn't get into his debut Summertime '06.</p>


<p>Goldlink: A talented yet mysterious artist from D.C.  Found myself listening to his The God Complex album.  His lyrics aren't the best but his production style is quite enjoyable, future bounce is I believe what they call it.  Sober Thoughts is a great song that sounds like it came from the 90's, with a chilled vibe.</p>

<p>Raury: As previously mentioned, Raury is a young electric musician from Atlanta, who incorporates all types of music into his repertoire, hit the scene last year with his mixtape 'Indigo Child.'</p>

<p>Dej Loaf: A female rapper from Detroit who sings more than she raps.  Back Up w/ Big Sean a catchy song but otherwise she does nothing for me.</p>

<p>Fetty Wap: How a one-eyed rapper with ugly dreadlocks can score so many hits is beyond me.  He sounds like a bad reggae artist when he sings, and he thinks that makes him different?  Most rappers sing these days.  Next...</p>

<p>K Camp: Another singing rapper with stupid lyrics.  He sounds more like a singer but I doubt he'll be relevant five years from now.</p>

<p>Shy Glizzy: Funeral is a nice song, but otherwise he doesn't seem special at all.</p>

<p>Tink: Another singing female.  Woopty doo!  Pass...</p>

<p>OG Maco: I heard one song of his, he sounds bizarre.  Plus that blond hair does nothing but make him look creepy.</p>

<p>Kidd Kidd: Once affiliated with the G-Unit, that's all I know about this guy.  Haven't even listened to him yet.</p>

<p>Quality songs worth mentioning that came out this year include a couple of great songs from A$AP Rocky, the Rod Stewart sampled and featured 'Everyday' and the Juicy J and Pimp C featured 'Wavybone' that sounds like the perfect song fitting his New York/Houston hybrid style that often comes with mixed results.  The aforementioned Devil's Whisper showcased a great and unique style from the young Raury.  Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis made their comeback with the somewhat clever/somewhat corny song Downtown, featuring old school rappers Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee and Grandmaster Caz, in a song showcasing various old styles of music.  Even Snoop Dogg found a quality song with a funk throwback Peaches &amp; Cream (who needs that reggae shit).</p>

<p>Also good were the following tracks: Alpha Omega by Machine Gun Kelly, Young Jesus by Logic, R.I.C.O. by Meek Mill (the song that started his stupid beef with Drake), Senorita by Vince Staples, Blessings by Big Sean, Money Trees Deuce by Jay Rock, Every Ghetto by Talib Kweli &amp; 9th Wonder, and Iron Rose by Cannibal Ox (I never thought the duo would reunite after their breakup many years ago).</p>

<p>With all of that said, there were some quality albums released this year.  Not quite as strong as years past, but still enough to make this rap fan satisfied.  There were also some quality songs from otherwise mediocre artists.  Here are my top nine albums of 2015 (no mixtapes included, with apologies to the Run the Jewels Meow the Jewels remix album), because I could only find nine albums to get.</p>

	<h4>To Pimp a Butterfly</h4>
</div>

<p>1. Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp A Butterfly: In a time where most rappers make crappy songs to get on the radio with little effort in their music and meaning, one rapper, Kendrick Lamar, excels amongst the other newcomers with his lyrical jaunts, unique production and capturing the raw emotions of all things Kendrick Lamar.  Tasked with outdoing the incredible Good Kid, M.a.a.d. City, Kendrick Lamar continues to show how to make quality music and get the deserved attention without obvious radio play.  With perhaps the best song of the year, the intense 'The Blacker the Berry,' Kendrick raps about the hypocrisy of gang violence, declaring himself 'I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015' which he concludes by rapping 'So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me? / Hypocrite!'.  Featuring a more funk-based version of Kendrick's jazzy stylings, Kendrick not only puts out songs with great beats, but those with thoughtful lyrics, including the inspiring 'Alright' where he proclaims 'we gon be alright' and 'Alls my life I has to fight, nigga,' a song has since been nominated for 'Song of the Year' at the Grammys, along with the funky 'King Kunta,' psychedlic and sexually-charged 'These Walls,' and of course, the popular i, remixed for the album with a slightly different beat, drawing more attention to the song's message (and acapella at the end to Oprah). Kendrick Lamar proves again why he is the best rapper out right now.</p>

	<h4>Compton</h4>
</div>

<p>2. Dr. Dre - Compton: Undoubtedly the surprise album of the year, coming completely out of nowhere and off guard, Dr. Dre proves that he still has the musical genius in him to craft a great album, even when so much has changed over the years.  Dr. Dre perfectly blends the classic sound with an updated twist on the magnificent 'Genocide' and 'Darkside/Gone.' With guest appearances from his talented group of rappers over the years, from Snoop Dogg to Eminem (Even if my image ends up taking a personal hit / Whoever I hurt or whatever bridged I burned /In this bitch and whatever bitches feel like / They didn't deserve what I did / And whatever consequences with every verse, it's worth it / So Doc turn the beat on, whose turn is it to get murdered on it?) to Kendrick Lamar (Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (boom, boom, boom)/ I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (boom, boom, boom)/ That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody/Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me), along with newcomers like Jon Connor(I told my city 'Hold me down', now look how high they hold me up / I'm Kobe clutch, I hold my nuts 'fore I was old enough to cuss), Dr. Dre provides a fitting end to his rap career.</p>

<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/badass.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="B4.Da.$$" class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>B4.Da.$$</h4>
</div>

<p>3. Joey Bada$$ - B4.Da.$$: The debut album for the young and talented Joey Bada$$ features him in his comfort zone; boom-bap east coast based production nostalgic of the great underground New York sound of the late 90's.  Joey, appreciative of the classic sound, hooks up with legends like DJ Premier, along with new legends like Statik Selektah in creating an album fitting of the era, yet with his lyrical prowess and themes fitting for himself.  A step up from his previous works though not perfect by any means, Joey Bada$$ showcases his style of music via the Scenario inspired 'No. 99,' the touching 'On &amp; On,' and the experimental 'Escape 120' featuring up-and-comer Raury.  At age 20, Joey Bada$$ is clever enough to draw attention (via his cleverly titled album, 'Before Da Money, or another way to spell his own name), yet like many of the greats, Joey has bright years to come to reach the full potential, with lyrics such as 'Cause every time I make a move they be sweatin' me / They want another black man in penitentiary / It's even hard for that man standing next to me / Cause he could catch a bullet that was really meant for me' showcasing his awareness of police brutality in the ghetto.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/wonderful.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mr. Wonderful" class="image block img-responsive pull-right" />
	<h4>Mr. Wonderful</h4>
</div>

<p>4. Action Bronson - Mr. Wonderful: The ever colorful rapper Action Bronson, with sick and crazy lyrics and a penchant for just having fun on his songs, releases his studio debut, Mr. Wonderful.  A departure from his rugged East Coast raps, Action Bronson goes all over the place with Mr. Wonderful.  Though it features traditional raps with 'Easy Rider' and 'Actin Crazy,' Bronsolino also flexes his experimental side with the bluesy vocals of 'City Boy Blues' and the Chance the Rapper featured 'Baby Blue.'  Action Bronson provides a fun-filled album while maintaining his lyrical prowess, where you will be impressed with lyrics such as 'There were times I used to hide my feelings / Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini / And motherfuckers can't see me / Wait 'till the chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy' but yet will sing along joyfully to 'I got a brand new car / I got a jazz guitar'.</p>

<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
<img src="/img/goodam.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="GO:OD AM" class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>GO:OD AM</h4>
</div>

<p>5. Mac Miller - GO:OD AM: Mac Miller, fresh off a roller-coaster ride that led him on a crazy drug binge and subsequently in rehab, released his most mature album yet with GO:OD AM.  Featuring Mac Miller having a more mature perspective on his crazy drug songs, Mac Miller releases his most honest work yet.  With tracks like 'Break the Law' and 'In the Bag,' Mac Miller shows he can still have fun on the record, but also shows his depth on the excellent two parter Perfect Circle/God Speed, which sees Mac Miller broken down and built back up with his spiraling drug use, with lyrics on Perfect Circle including, 'Yeah, blame the drugs, got me sinning on the weekday/Drunk as fuck, doing buck sixty on the freeway/Giving y'all the freebase, hidden in the middle of a briefcase,' while on God Speed he raps 'Them pills that I'm popping, I need to man up / It's a problem, I need a wake up / Before one morning I don't wake up' showing the redemption of his drug abuse.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">
	<img src="/img/love.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Love Story" class="image block img-responsive pull-right" />
	<h4>Love Story</h4>
</div>

<p>6. Yelawolf - Love Story: After releasing his disappointing debut Radioactive late in 2011, Yelawolf follows it up with a much more honest and fitting follow-up, the ironically titled Love Story.  Tapping into his southern roots, Yelawolf releases a surprising cohesive album, blending southern rock, country and even bluegrass while rapping about the pain and suffering he's experienced since his debut album, with lyrics of struggles including 'Daddy I've been thinkin' about you lately / Mama's never here and step daddy hates me / He drinks a lot, it makes him so mean / Mama always screams and it gives me bad dreams.'  With Eminem as his only guest feature on the excellent 'Best Friend,' Yelawolf also finds his groove on the country inspired 'Till It's Gone,' the funkadelic inspired 'Outer Space' or the Johnny Cash inspired track named after him.  Though not for everyone, Yelawolf finally feels comfortable here, and not rapping corny love songs he clearly didn't want to make.</p>

<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
	<img src="/img/special.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Special Effects" class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>Special Effects</h4>
</div>

<p>7. Tech N9ne - Special Effects: Tech N9ne, always unpredictable and crazy, released his newest solo album, Special Effects in May.  As with any Tech N9ne album, Tech shows off a wide variety of styles, from the dark 'Psycho Bitch III' featuring equally the dark and crazy Hopsin with a show-stealing verse, to the party jams like 'Hood Go Crazy,' featuring B.o.B. and 2 Chainz (enough to show that Tech N9ne doesn't go mainstream, mainstream goes Tech) and of course, the highly anticipated 'Speeddm (WWC2)' collaboration with the great Eminem showcasing the speed raps.  Special Effects, in a departure from his other albums, finds Tech N9ne in even more oddball styled songs, whether it's Trap music or EDM, but yet Tech remains his lovely self, covering a variety of topics 'But why you gotta let the bodies dropping at a coffee shop in Aussie (Aussie, Oi Oi Oi) / But around here, loving coco's the bomb / Meanwhile so many people are taken out by the hands of Boko Haram / Aw yeah?!' as well as flexing his ability to flip words 'Just a crone phall, then it's on y'all / Fuck around and get ya dome sawed off a brone stawl / I can't wait to hear ya squeal and holler / How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga'.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">
	<img src="/img/soursoul.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sour Soul" class="image block img-responsive pull-right" />
	<h4>Soul Soul</h4>
</div>

<p>8. BADBADNOTGOOD &amp; Ghostface Killah - Sour Soul: Ghostface Killah, still strong after twenty years of success via the Wu-Tang Clan and many of his excellent solo albums, collaborated with Canadian jazz trio BADBADNOTGOOD to create Sour Soul, a nice relaxing album sure to satisfy Ghostface Killah's longtime fans as well as those who like a more jazzy backdrop.  Though the album is short (and with three tracks out of twelve being instrumentals), Ghostface makes the best of his use, still capable of dropping dope lines 'Dangerous thoughts, mind of a militia / Bottles of the 1-50 poured over twistas / Broken bones and pillars,Staten Island the illest /The biggest land fillers, we creep like caterpillars '.  Featuring a show-stealing verse on 'Six Degrees' from the unpredictable and possibly insane Danny Brown 'What's on the menu? Eat a rapper like butternut squash / Bark on a nigga with the blade out / Run up in your safehouse, how ironic /Knock a ring on a nigga like somebody hit Sonic', along with songs featuring the underrated Elzhi and mysterious DOOM (still waiting for that collabo album), Sour Soul is a nice little project to relax to.</p>


<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
	<img src="/img/surf.png" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Surf" class="image block img-responsive" />
	<h4>Surf</h4>
</div>
<p>9. Donnie Trumpet &amp; The Social Experiment - Surf: The Social Experiment, a hip-hop/jazz/pop quartet fronted by Chance the Rapper, released their debut album Surf in May exclusively on iTunes as a free download.  Though Chance the Rapper is never going to win 'lyricist of the year,' with corny lyrics like 'I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma/You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma' or 'Bit of a pickle, she tuck her tommy/Rugrat, bare skin, fair skin,' nor inspire people with his oddball adlibs, Chance the Rapper does get credit for maintaining a musical vision and not rapping 'for the radio.'  Released for the summertime in mind, Surf is an interesting mix of hip-hop, jazz and pop blended in through the backings of The Social Experiment, with an impressive guest list including J. Cole, Busta Rhymes, B.o.B. and Big Sean.  Standout tracks include the jazzy 'Miracle,' the fun trumpet stylings of 'Slip Slide' and the sweet pop sound of 'Sunday Candy' which you can't help but sing along to.</p>
