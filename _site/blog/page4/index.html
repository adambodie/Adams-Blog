  <h1>Dumb and Dumber - Why the Top Republican Presidential Candidates Suck at Math</a></h1>
	<div class="row">

  <p class="author">

  <p class="intro">Tomorrow is the official start of the 2016 Presidential Election process in the United States, with the Iowa Caucus deciding who becomes the first leader in the race. Although it's no guarantee the winner of the Iowa Caucus becomes the nominee (i.e Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012 on the Republican side), it does say something about each party in general. With all of that said, the top two ranked Republican candidates in Iowa, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have pushed the bounds on extremism and pure hatred. It's no wonder establish Republicans are actively concerned about these two winning the Republican nomination, as some Republicans are smarter than others.</p>

  <p class="intro">Does everyone know the song 'I Fought the Law,' with the famous lyrics, 'I fought the law, and the law won?' Good, it will help you get a better understand why Ammon Bundy and his terrorist militiamen friends will face a harsh reality now that they have been arrested for taking over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. After three weeks holding the place hostage, threatening to shoot law enforcement should they try to take them out, and leaving the people of Harney county scared, Ammon Bundy and his goons were finally arrested after 8 of them left to to attend a town meeting in the town of John Day.</p>

  <h1>Super Bowl 50 - Look at that Smile!</a></h1>

  <p class="author">

  <p class="intro">Super Bowl 50 is on its way, featuring a match-up of the NFL's top two defenses, the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers (1 and 2 respectively). The biggest headline will likely be the probable MVP this year, Carolina QB Cam Newton, a very talented but cocky player. There are quite a few people that find Cam Newton obnoxious and arrogant, whether it's his me-first attitude or his 'Dab' dancing whenever he scores a touchdown. But on the other hand, how can you hate someone with a smile like his?</p>

  <h1>White Privilege II - Why We Need a Conversation on Race</a></h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">January 23, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Yesterday, the hip-hop game was jolted by the new song from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, 'White Privilege II,' a vicious track almost nine minutes long that discusses racism in the hip-hop world, in general, the Black Lives Matter movement, and how 'White America' is at an advantage as opposed to minorities. Though this is not the first time Macklemore has discussed racism in his music; the original White Privilege was a song he released back in 2005, now that Macklemore is famous worldwide, the platform is expanded exponentially with his fame, social media and a generation of racism sensitivity. Therefore, more people have a say than they did in 2005, when Macklemore was just a starving underground rapper from Seattle that until his unprecedented rise to fame, represented a city whose only taste of mainstream success was Sir Mix-a-Lot and his butt loving song Baby Got Back. While Macklemore will never understand what it's like to actually be a black person (something he is completely aware with), this track is important nonetheless as we will never get past racism without talking about it.</p>

  <h1>Why Flint Matters</a></h1>

  <p class="author">

  <p class="intro">A few months ago, while campaigning for President, Donald Trump, known for stupid comments, remarked that President Obama made his stupidest remark ever when he declared 'global warming' our number one enemy.  Donald Trump, wanting to scare people into thinking everyone is going to be attacked by a foreigner any second now, wants to diminish global warming because his party doesn't believe in it.  This of course is the same man who believes the Chinese created global warming to gain a financial edge.  But with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, people should be more aware of global warming and the effect the environment in general has on our society.</p>

  <h1>Making a Murderer - My Thoughts on the Steven Avery case</a></h1>

  <p class="intro">Much buzz has surrounded the Netflix film-documentary 'Making a Murderer,' about a Wisconsin man named Steven Avery who spent 18 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, only to get charged and convicted of murder just two years after his release from prison.  The show and the case has attracted a lot of attention, getting enough votes for a petition on the White House's website to require the White House to answer the petition (F.Y.I. Obama can't pardon Steven Avery as the case was tried in state court, not the federal court).  The big question on everyone's mind, did Steven Avery really kill Teresa Halbach, or did someone frame him for exposing corruption for his false conviction?  Here are my thoughts on the case.</p>

  <h1>College Football Championship Preview</a></h1>

  	<span class="date">January 4, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">A week from today, the college football season ends with the national championship game between #1 Clemson and #2 Alabama.  A fitting championship game between the two best teams in the country.  Seeing Clemson slow down Oklahoma's high powered offense and Alabama completely shutting Michigan State down, it's clear these two were on a collision course for quite some time.  So who wins the big game?  Here are my two cents.</p>

  <h1>Militiamen - Anti-Government Hypocrites</a></h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">January 3, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On January 2nd, 2016, a group of militiamen, led by Ammon Bundy, the son of famed anti-government law breaking tax cheat Cliven Bundy, took over a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon.  Though Burns is on the other side of the state (and a completely different world than where I live), it's insulting that these idiots are fighting to 'save' two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, whom have accepted their faiths to report to prison for their crimes and it's even stupider that these anti-government wackos think that they can do whatever they want as long as they wave their guns and American flags in the name of freedom.</p>

  <p class="intro">The 2015 season for the Minnesota Golden Gophers didn't quite meet the expectations that many fans might have had after a well-played 2014 season, but yet despite the bumps in the road, Minnesota is showing signs of life as a competitive football team.  Whether 2016 will be any better remains to be seen, but at the moment, Minnesota did vanquish at least one demon.</p>
