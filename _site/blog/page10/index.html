  <p class="intro">After the official launch of Bodie Web Design 2.0 (as I call it), I received a lot of nice compliments from those who checked it.  Thank you all for your nice words.  One comment from my wonderful Auntie Sheri was that she loved it, and that she could make this web page too.  So with those comments, here is how I made Bodie Web Design 2 and how you could too.</p>

  <h1>College Football Championship Preview</h1>

  	<span class="date">January 4, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">A week from today, the college football season ends with the national championship game between #1 Clemson and #2 Alabama.  A fitting championship game between the two best teams in the country.  Seeing Clemson slow down Oklahoma's high powered offense and Alabama completely shutting Michigan State down, it's clear these two were on a collision course for quite some time.  So who wins the big game?  Here are my two cents.</p>

  <h1>Militiamen - Anti-Government Hypocrites</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">January 3, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On January 2nd, 2016, a group of militiamen, led by Ammon Bundy, the son of famed anti-government law breaking tax cheat Cliven Bundy, took over a federal building at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon.  Though Burns is on the other side of the state (and a completely different world than where I live), it's insulting that these idiots are fighting to 'save' two local ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, whom have accepted their faiths to report to prison for their crimes and it's even stupider that these anti-government wackos think that they can do whatever they want as long as they wave their guns and American flags in the name of freedom.</p>

  <p class="intro">The 2015 season for the Minnesota Golden Gophers didn't quite meet the expectations that many fans might have had after a well-played 2014 season, but yet despite the bumps in the road, Minnesota is showing signs of life as a competitive football team.  Whether 2016 will be any better remains to be seen, but at the moment, Minnesota did vanquish at least one demon.</p>

  <h1>Hip Hop 2015 - The Year it Was</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">December 20, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Another year has gone by, and for an avid hip-hop fan like myself, I can sum up the year in general as mediocre.  While Kendrick Lamar continued his onslaught as the most talented rapper at the moment (with apologies to legends like Eminem or Nas, who were relatively quiet this year), many of the highly regarded albums in the world of popular rap were filled with syrupy R&amp;B beats and ridiculous R&amp;B singing in their raps (here's looking at you Fetty Wap).  While there were plenty of rappers with rap albums who actually rap, the most attention still ends up with Drake, whose corny beats, pointless beefs and a collaboration with equally lame rapper Future dominated the news.</p>

  <h1>Catching the Porzinger Fever</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">December 18, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On the night of the 2015 NBA Draft, many people turned in to see which young prospects their team would select. Though the NBA Draft was held in Barclays Center (home of the Brooklyn Nets), it's fans of the New York Knicks (who play in the Madison Square Garden, the traditional home of the draft) that are the loudest and most obnoxious. Many of their fans don't know a whole lot about all the prospects, mostly knowing those they see on TV, i.e. those who play for big time college basketball teams, which is why, when the New York Knicks selected a young Latvian kid named Kristaps Porzingis, they loudly booed the selection.</p>

  <p class="intro">Dear America: We have an epidemic occurring through our nation and despite repeated outbreaks, none of our leaders are willing to figure a way to get it done.  In fact, many of them don't think we should do anything at all.  That epidemic of course, is gun violence.  So please America, let's have an honest conversation on how to best handle gun violence and stop with the lies upon lies we keep hearing.</p>

  <h1>Thanks for the Great Memories Kobe</h1>

  <p class="intro">When I was 11 years old, I liked to get NBA jerseys.  I loved the sport and thought it was cool to wear them.  Some of them I bought for the design, like Grant Hill's Detroit Pistons jersey with the horse logo (what would you expect, I was young and loved the animal logos, even the Toronto Raptors Dinosaur logo which, like Detroit's logo then looked hideous by today's standards).  Others were for my local team that I liked growing up, the Portland Trail Blazers, that of the great Arvydas Sabonis.  I even got a throwback jersey of Dr. J from the Philadelphia 76ers.  But there's one jersey which I still have to this day as a collector item, a rookie jersey of Kobe Bryant.</p>

  <h1>History in the Making - The Lakers on the Wrong Side Edition</h1>

  <p class="intro">Tonight, the Lakers play the Golden State Warriors in a game with the potential of making history.  While the Lakers are used to setting records, tonight it's the Warriors, 15-0, looking for the most consecutive wins the start the season.  Let's be honest, the Lakers have no shot of winning in Golden State.  It's 20-7 as I type this sentence.  But watching the Warriors play, makes me wonder how things have changed drastically in the NBA.</p>

  <h1>Donald Trump - Master Manipulator</h1>

  	<span class="date">November 23, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Next year, the United States will elect a new president to lead our country.  We have many candidates to choose from.  Unfortunately, politics, campaigns and spending bring out lots of ugly, negative comments, childish bickering and aiming for the lowest common denominator attempts to attract voters.  Not surprisingly, one candidate stands out in this department, a man obsessed with himself, always trying to gain attention by any means necessary, and a firm believer of 'no news is bad new,'  That man of course, is a man famous for building a rich empire and starring in reality TV shows, Donald Trump.</p>
