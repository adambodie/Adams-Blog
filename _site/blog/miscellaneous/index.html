            <p class="intro">Today marks the one year anniversary to my launch of Adam’s Blog.  It's come a long way from its humble roots, going through my major redesign in April.  So to honor my blog, here's a brief history of my blog and how I wound up getting here, along with some of my favorite posts.</p>

            <p class="intro">On August 29th, a group of idiots, believing they can do whatever they want without any repercussions, destroyed a famous rock at Cape Kiwanda known as Duckbill.  Fortunately, someone recorded them committing the act and confronted them over it.  But the damage was done, all because some idiots couldn’t read a sign and blamed everyone but themselves for something that was obviously avoidable.  Too many people take nature for granted, and it deserves every bit of respect it gets.</p>

  <p class="intro">For many years, my Mom has been on a quest to find her family roots, never knowing who her biological father was.  Recently, a DNA test found my Mom with 47% European Jewish, 34% Great Britain and 16% other.  I've always wanted to know about my family roots as well, and with my Mom's interest, I was able was able to dig deeper than before to find that her Great-Grandpa's Barnet and Harry were born in the Suwałki area of what was then part of Russia, an area now part of Poland with a portion of its historical area in Lithuania.  So what is Suwałki?  Here is an expose on an area where I have roots.</p>

  <p class="intro">Today I reached 111,111 miles on my lovely Barracuda, my first and so far only car that I've had for a little over 11 years.  It seemed like just yesterday that I got my first car, as Dad drove me back home from Eugene to spend the weekend at home, only to see a nice 2005 silver Honda Accord DX sitting in the driveway with a big bow on it.  Little did I know that the car was there waiting for me to enjoy it.  For those who don't know the story of its name, the first song I played in the car was Heart's hit song, Barracuda. I've had many wonderful trips with my Barracuda, from the Oregon Coast to Memphis, from Seattle to Chicagoland, 22 states in all.  I've had a lifetime of adventures with Barracuda, from the highs to the lows (though never more than a little scratch).  In honor of my wonderful times on the road, here is a countdown of my Top 11 Road Trips for 111,111 miles.</p>

        <p class="intro">When I was young, I only saw beer in black and white. Obviously, I didn't drink beer, but my Mom occasionally drank beer, mainly when we went to the Oak Hills Brewpub, where she ordered the dark beers, the Porters and Stouts. From then, I considered
            good beers to be dark, while crap beers like Bud, Miller and Coors as the bad beers. It wasn't until I was 26 that I decided to try beer for the first time, as McMenamins on Allen and Murray. I had a sampler of dark and light beers, mainly
            interested in the Black Rabbit Porter and Terminator Stout. From then on, I found myself trying all styles of beers, dark and light, where I learned there's more than just BMC crap (Bud-Miller-Coors for the uninformed).</p>

            supported me along the way, because I wouldn't be the person I am without the loving support of my family and friends.</p>

 <h1>Rape - A Nasty Side Effect of Society's Mistreatment of Women</h1>

        <p class="intro">Much buzz on the news is about a rapist name Brock Turner, a former Stanford swimmer who raped an unconscious woman and received just six months in prison for it, despite being convicted of three felony sexual assault charges. Though the defendant
            claims he understands what he did was wrong, he has managed to show how little responsibility he has actually taken for his crimes, feeling like he is the victim just as much as the woman he raped. Cases like this show just how little regard
            some men have for women in general and how that, more than anything, leads to rape.</p>

        <p class="intro">Four years ago, I set out to write an article on Innocent Online Stalking. The results of the article were quite fascinating. I met a young woman named Jennifer Bodie and asked her about her online stalking. She described in length how it affected
            her and why she did it. I decided to do a follow up to check in with Jenn and see if she's still doing it.</p>
