<p> For many years, my Mom has been on a quest to find her family roots, never knowing who her biological father was.  Recently, a DNA test found my Mom with 47% European Jewish, 34% Great Britain and 16% other.  I've always wanted to know about my family roots as well, and with my Mom's interest, I was able was able to dig deeper than before to find that her Great-Grandpa's Barnet and Harry were born in the Suwałki area of what was then part of Russia, an area now part of Poland with a portion of its historical area in Lithuania.  So what is Suwałki?  Here is an expose on an area where I have roots.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/Vistytis.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Lake Vištytis" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Lake Vištytis</h4>
</div>

<p>Historically speaking, Suwałki was part of Congress Poland, an area of modern-day Poland and Lithuania occupied by Russia.  The area in the 19th Century had a significant Jewish population, with the oldest Synagogue built in 1821.  In 1897, 10% of the Suwałki Governorate, (which had around 589,200 people in total) was Jewish.  The largest town in the area was Suwałki itself, but had other towns with Jewish residents, including Vištytis, which appears to the be the likely town my Pearlstein family came from, based on its Polish translation Wisztyniec, where evidence pointed to a place called "Wistenez" I pulled from a World War II Registration Card from one of my Great-Great Grandfathers.  So where exactly did my family come from?</p>

<p>The Suwałki region has historically been a conflict area between Poland, Lithuania, and somewhat Russia, whose exclave Kaliningrad is also within range of the Suwalki region.  After World War I, when Germany occupied the area,  Poland and Lithuania became independent states, no longer control of Russia, but their borders were contested, as Lithuania, with a majority population in the Suwałki region, claimed part of it as its own, even though it was never theirs historically.  This led to the Polish-Lithuanian War from 1919-1920, which led to a peace treaty giving control of the Suwałki region to Poland. </p>

		<h4>The historical Suwałki region (in yellow) in comparison to Lithuania today</h4>
</div>

<p>Sadly, all the Jews in the Suwałki region were killed in World War II after Nazi Germany took over Poland and the Suwałki region, desecrating their homes as well as the Jewish Cemetery.  Today, there are no Jews in the area, just an empty cemetery buried with Jews.  Quite sad, like the whole Holocaust itself.  I found an interesting article on the History of Jews in the Suwałki area, which you can read by clicking <a href="http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/suwalki/history.htm">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>As for Vištytis, I found this small town in Lithuania, just miles away from the Poland and right on the Russia (Kaliningrad) border.  Sitting along a lake with the same name, Vištytis had a good number of Jews, though many emigrated to Germany, the United States and South Africa starting in the 1850s.  Vištytis was also the subject of Nazi Germany, as an estimated 200-400 Jewish residents (amongst the 1,000 total in town) were all murdered.  Today, a memorial and 'Jewish' tombstone can be found in town to honor the Jews whose lives were lost in World War II.</p>

		<h4>My Jewish roots can be found within the red circle.</h4>
</div>
<p>I always wondered where my Jewish family came from.  Growing up, I was told Latvia, which I thought was pretty cool, especially for school assignments about my ancestry since no one else had that area, but seeing the census records for Barnet and Harry, they all stated their births in neighboring Lithuania.  I knew at the time, it was a part of Russia, so either way I knew it was in one of the Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia).  Finding out the specific area yesterday of Suwałki, I thought it was cool that it was in modern day Poland, but with the additional research on a fascinating area, I concluded that it was in fact Lithuania, just very close to Poland.  I never thought to connect those two places next to each other, so reading up on this history is quite interesting, especially when I have history there.  It's also a sad reminder of the Holocaust, to read about it many times is sad, but to know the area my ancestors came from were victims of a horrific time makes me sad and puts a personal touch to it.  Anyway you put it, I'm proud of who I am.</p>
