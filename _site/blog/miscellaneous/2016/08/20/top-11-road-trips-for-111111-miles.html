		<h4>111,111 Miles</h4>
</div>
<p> Today I reached 111,111 miles on my lovely Barracuda, my first and so far only car that I've had for a little over 11 years.  It seemed like just yesterday that I got my first car, as Dad drove me back home from Eugene to spend the weekend at home, only to see a nice 2005 silver Honda Accord DX sitting in the driveway with a big bow on it.  Little did I know that the car was there waiting for me to enjoy it.  For those who don't know the story of its name, the first song I played in the car was Heart's hit song, Barracuda. I've had many wonderful trips with my Barracuda, from the Oregon Coast to Memphis, from Seattle to Chicagoland, 22 states in all.  I've had a lifetime of adventures with Barracuda, from the highs to the lows (though never more than a little scratch).  In honor of my wonderful times on the road, here is a countdown of my Top 11 Road Trips for 111,111 miles.</p>

		<h4>Palouse Falls</h4>
</div>
    <p><strong>11. Walla Walla: March 18, 2016 - March 19, 2016:</strong>  Having just starting a full time job at Seterus, I spent my first day off heading to Walla Walla, Washington, where I planned to spend the night in the town and explore the area.  After reaching Walla Walla, I enjoyed a nice little walk around its charming downtown, before crashing for the night.  The following day, after driving through the odd yet photogenic Palouse Hills, stopping in Waitsburg, I reached the highlight of my trip: Palouse Falls, the official waterfall of the State of Washington, which was quite amazing to me.  I then went back home after a nice long day, with a brief stop at Grandma's for dinner (albeit a very late dinner) and some nice Apple Pie (see editors note below)</p>

		<h4>Painted Hills</h4>
</div>    
    <p><strong>10. John Day Fossil Beds: May 20, 2009:</strong> Though it was only a day trip while I spent a few days in Central Oregon with my Mom, attending a conference in Redmond, I managed to go out to the most stunningly unique place in all of Oregon (perhaps the United States) at the Painted Hills of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.  Stuck in the middle of nowhere past Pruneville (sorry... Prineville), with virtually no life in between, the Painted Hills are a reminder of just how special our planet is.  Walking around the Painted Hills and up through the paths is something I will never forget.  I also made it to the Sheep Rock Unit of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, which also had plenty of amazing views.  I even found myself a very unique souvenir in the middle of nowhere, but I've already said too much, hehehe.</p>

		<h4>Crater Lake</h4>
</div>    
    <p><strong>9. Southern Oregon: September 6, 2014 - September 7, 2014:</strong> Despite being 4 1/2 hours away from home (and 2 1/2 away from Eugene while I was at the U of O), I never took the drive down to Southern Oregon until two years ago.  Not quite the Willamette Valley but a far cry from everything east of the Cascades, Southern Oregon has its own little charm.  From Shakesphere USA, a.k.a. Ashland, to the charming western town of Jacksonville, there's fun things to see that's unique to Oregon in its own ways.  Though a fire left the weather odd the first day, it cleared up the second day as I made my way to Crater Lake National Park.  Though not my first time there, I really took the time to appreciate Crater Lake this time around and was extremely impressed.  Stops along the way back at Watson and Toketee Falls highlighted my trip, reminding me why Oregon has some of the best waterfalls around.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/smith-rock.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Smith Rock" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Smith Rock</h4>
</div>       
    <p><strong>8. Smith Rock: May 15, 2009:</strong> Though just a day trip, my first time at Smith Rock felt like I was there forever, as I went on the hike of my lifetime, starting from the bottom of Smith Rock, reaching the top along Misery Ridge Trail, before heading back down and looping around the River Trail.  There has been no trail I've completed more daunting, more exhilirating nor more utterly insane than Smith Rock.  But believe me, it was worth it, seeing Smith Rock from the top of the trail, being up close with Monkey Face, and perfect views of the Cascades and beyond.  By the time I was done, I was just about exhausted, with the drive home ahead of me.  But if there's any hike I'll remember, it's that one.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/sioux-falls.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sioux Falls" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Sioux Falls</h4>
</div>        
    <p><strong>7. Sioux Falls: June 4, 2007 - June 5, 2007:</strong> Heading to Minnesota, Dad and I passed Sioux Falls but didn't see much of the town.  All the excitement that day was from the sudden rainstorm that completely washed away from front bumber full of bugs.  But just 4 hours away from Minneapolis, I thought it would be fun to see what Sioux Falls had to offer.  The centerpiece of the city, the falls for which the city is named after was a great place to visit, with the Big Sioux River flowing through each section, more twists and turns.  There wasn't much to see otherwise, but being in South Dakota also meant 75 mph speed limit, which meant I could really rip it without a worry, reaching briefly up to 90 mph when I knew no cops were around.  After seeing the Mitchell Corn Palace (which I heard about when Dad and I spent the night there), I went back into Minnesota and stopped at the peacefully beautiful Pipestone National Monument, perfectly green and seeing some nice Native American history along the way.  Brief stops in New Ulm and Mankato, Minnesota rounded up a nice trip to see some different parts of Minnesota.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/menominee.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Menominee Pier Light" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Menominee Pier Light</h4>
</div>     
    <p><strong>6. Green Bay: December 19, 2006 - December 20, 2006:</strong> My first major trip once I arrived in Minnesota was going to Green Bay, home of the Packers.  Green Bay isn't the most exciting city out there, but there were plenty of adventures along the way, including stops in the funny named Wausau, the northern wooded areas of Wisconsin, mainly the town of Rhinelander and its lovely mythical Hodag, and even the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where I stopped in the towns of Iron Mountain and Menominee, the latter home of one of my favorite pictures ever of the Menominee Pier Lighthouse.  As for Green Bay itself, I saw Lambeau Field (nice stadium, better than the old Metrodome which thankfully got replaced), the bay itself and the Fox River.  In all, a nice first overnight trip.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/reno.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Reno" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Reno</h4>
</div>      
    <p><strong>5. Reno: July 18, 2016 - July 21, 2016:</strong>  Coming in at Number 5 is the trip I took last month, a multi-day extravaganza to Reno, full of fun and excitement.  From driving through California the first day to reach Reno was plenty of fun, seeing Mt. Shasta and stopping amongst its favorite towns (especially Weed), and the amazingly beautiful Burney Falls.  With the main part of Reno right at my fingertips at Circus Circus Reno, seeing the big hotels, the Reno Arch and more.  The second day of my trip brought me to the stunningly blue Lake Tahoe, which after a stop at Carson City, was a breathtaking experience on both sides of the border, along with Stateline right at the border.  The third day of my fun trip saw me walking around Reno, since I needed a break from driving, seeing more of the fun city.  Finally, when it was all said and done, I headed towards home, seeing the Lava Beds National Monument and its historical glory, along with Klamath Falls (whoopdee do!) and Salt Creek Falls (wow!)</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/st-louis.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="St. Louis" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>St. Louis</h4>
</div>      
    <p><strong>4. St. Louis-Memphis: May 17, 2007 - May 21, 2007:</strong>  Driving down to St. Louis and Memphis was a lot of fun, even though the trip didn't turn out exactly as I hope, but I'm a better person for it.  Starting my way down through Wisconsin, I first stopped in the city of Beloit, before reaching Rockford, Illinois enjoying views of the Rock River before reaching my main destination of the day, Springfield, Illinois, where I saw plenty of Abraham Lincoln related history and government buildings along the way.  I even had a hamburger with fries in it.  Quite interesting.  The following day brought me to the amazing St. Louis, where upon first entering the city, I was immediately amazed by the beautiful and graceful Gateway Arch overlooking the city.  Thankfully I was stuck in traffic to get a beautiful picture of the skyline from a bridge.  Even more amazing was going into the Gateway Arch and riding its odd and unique tram ride to the top, an experience that can only be described as futuristic.  Seeing a few more places in St. Louis along the way, I made my way down to Memphis, but thanks to the Infamous Cape Girardeau Incident, I was stuck before I got there.  After that nightmare, I made it to Memphis the following day, enjoying Graceland, Beale Street and everything in between, along with a nice order of catfish in a fun musical town.  I thought about turning around from Cape Girardeau, but I knew this was my only moment, and so far, I've been right.  Memphis was a blast, but I made my back back home, spending the day in Tennessee, Mississippi (briefly), Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky (briefly), six states in one day.  Amongst my stops were Cairo, the southernmost point of Illinois, where the Mississippi and Ohio River meets, Collinsville, Illinois where the Cahokia Mounds are located (another great Native American related site) and back to St. Louis to see Forest Park, a beautiful place, before spending the night in Bowling Green, Missouri.  The final day of my trip brought me to Hannibal, Missouri (a.k.a. Mark Twainsville U.S.A.), Iowa City to see the Old State Capitol (and not the corn eating Iowa Hawkeyes) and Cedar Rapids, a nice medium sized city for Iowa's sake.  Suffice to say, I covered lots of ground on this trip.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/kansas-city.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Kansas City" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Kansas City</h4>
</div>      
    <p><strong>3. Kansas City: January 7, 2007 - January 9, 2007:</strong> My first superlong trip brought me to Kansas City, Missouri.  Waking up early in excitement, I drove down I-35 and enjoyed the sunrise in Iowa.  With no stops along the way (I figured I'd enjoy Des Moines on the way back), I made it to Kansas City, and became impressed with a city that reminded me a lot of Minneapolis.  I spent the day in Kansas City, seeing the views from the Liberty Memorial (unfortunately, I couldn't climb the memorial itself, but didn't have to do so), the Nelson-Atkins Art Museum with the giant Shuttlecocks and plenty more, before enjoying some authentic Kansas City BBQ at Arthur Bryant's.  The next day brought me to St. Joseph, Missouri (briefly stopping in Kansas) to enjoy some of the sights (I even passed through Oregon, Missouri) before reaching Omaha, Nebraska, where I enjoyed the city and some of what it had to offer (despite it being extremely windy).  The final day of my trip brought me back to Des Moines, where I ended up stopping this time around, to see their golden State Capitol and the city itself.  In all, a fantastic trip with no hiccups along the way.</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/chicago.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Chicago" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Chicago</h4>
</div>      
    <p><strong>2. Milwaukee-Chicago: March 10, 2007 - March 12, 2007:</strong>  Once in a while, you have a day so perfect that it will forever be known as Adam Day (a day to enjoy all things Adam and have fun).  That was was the second day of this trip, in Chicago.  But first, I had to get there.  With more snow on the grouund in Minnesota and Wisconsin, it was far different from my Kansas City trip that had no major snow, so heading to the Wisconsin Dells, I stopped to enjoy its waterparks that were closed for the season, but photogenic nonetheless.  I also got stuck in the snow, but got help out shortly, and continued my trip down to Madison, the state capital surrounded by two big lakes, and oddly formed city but beautiful and unique nonetheless.  After reaching Milwaukee, I enjoyed visiting the city, from its skyline views from Lake Michigan to the absolutely stunning Milwaukee Art Museum that looked out of this world.  I spent the night there, heading down to Chicago the next day, where everything (except for the cost) ended up being perfect.  From Sears Tower (I don't care what they call it now, it's still Sears Tower to me) to the John Hancock Building, I enjoyed views from the highest buildings in the country.  On the ground, I saw Millenium Park with the beautiful Cloud Gate sculpture that can only be described as flawless, and enjoyed great views of the city from the edge of Lake Michigan.  After stopping in Gary, Indiana (for the sake of being in Indiana, and the see the Jackson's childhood home), I returned to Chicago, where I enjoyed great Chicago cuisine not once, but twice at Portillo's, having a Chicago hot dog (definitely not from Nathan's Hot Dogs at the Mall of America) for lunch and an Italian Beef sandwich for dinner, two Chicago specialities.  Once my perfect day in Chicago was over, I returned to Milwaukee for the night, enduring a horrific line pass the toll-gate into Wisconsin, yuck).  The last leg of my trip brought me to multiple Wisconsin cities along Lake Michigan (Manitowoc and Sheboygan) and Lake Winnebago (Fond du Lac, Oshkosh and Appleton), where I saw plenty of nice things along the way, including Lake Winnebago covered in ice.  With that said and done, my trip was over and I headed back home.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/rushmore.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Mt. Rushmore" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Mt. Rushmore</h4>
</div>      
    <p><strong>1. Moving to Minnesota: August 29, 2006 - September 1, 2006:</strong>  For all of my fun and exciting trips, there was only one that defined me to make all of this happen, my move to Minnesota, where my new life at the University of Minnesota was waiting for me.  Although my Dad did most of the driving, having a U-Haul attached to the back of my car, travelling across country to start my new life brought plenty of adventures.  The first day of the trip brought me from Portland all the way to Butte, Montana, driving through Spokane, the Idaho Panhandle and Missoula, Montana along the way.  The next day was filled with all the excitement as we made our way through Yellowstone National Park, where we saw geysers, hot springs and of course, plenty of Bison crossing the road, holding us up in the most unique and eventful traffic stop one could possibly imagine.  After leaving Yellowstone, we drove through Wyoming, going up and down every twist and turn of the Bighorn Mountains in a drive that can only be described as cautious.  After reaching the top and seeing nothing but plains, we spent the night in Sheridan, Wyoming, enjoying a restaurant with crap on walls, Sanford's Pub and Grub.  The next leg of the trip brought us to Mt. Rushmore, which can only be described as beautiful.  Surrounded by the Black Hills, Mt. Rushmore was incredible to see, and a place every proud loving American should see if they get the chance.  After that, it was on to driving through the Great Plains, which certainly wasn't very exciting, but plenty of Wall Drug signs on each side of I-90 available, it was necessary to go through, before reaching Mitchell, South Dakota, with my Barracuda covered in dead bug carcass on the front bumper.  Fortunately, a rainstorm in the night washed it all right off, and just five hours away from my new home in Minneapolis, we finally made it, where plenty of adventures awaited me.</p>

    <p><em>Editor's Note: One night while at my Grandma's, she told me we were having Apple Pie for dessert, which I don't like (but would prefer Grandma's Apple Pie over store bought pie).  I gave her an odd expression, either due to confusion of tiredness.  But ever since then, I always ask my Grandma when we will have Apple Pie, well knowing it's not Apple Pie.</em></p>
