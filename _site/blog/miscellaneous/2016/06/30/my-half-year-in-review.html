<p> We've reached the end of June, which essentially means we're halfway through the year.  I've had a successful year so far, and I'm aiming to continue that with an even better second half of the year.  So here's to me, but also to those who have supported me along the way, because I wouldn't be the person I am without the loving support of my family and friends.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>I've won this quarter (and half).  Thanks for the encouragement today, Barley the Hop.</h4>
</div>

<p>My year started off pretty bad; I was really sick.  It started just before my Dad's birthday on December 30th, and I don't know what got me, but it left me feeling awful.  I developed Walking Pneumonia, which helped me realize that there are far worse things than an Ear Infection.  I ended up with one of them afterwards, and that was no fun either.  It was not a good time for me, but it could have been a lot worse.</p>

<p>But despite that, I had a lot to look for and a lot I knew I was rebound greatly.  The reason for that, I was aiming for a full time job at Seterus.  After submitting my application and going through the interview process, I finally got my first time job as a Correspondence Support Specialist.  All the hard work I put in finally paid off, as I officially became an IBMer.  My first official day as an IBMer was February 15th, and I haven't looked back since.  It's the beginning of the next stage of my master improvement plan I've been working on for the past five years or so.  Still a few steps left in that game but it's a significant milestone for me.  In fact, it was June 29th of last year that I began my career at Seterus.  It wasn't what I was expecting, but as my Mom always says, 'things happen for a reason,' and somehow, I ended up at the right place at this time.</p>
<p>Being an official IBMer has its perks.  Asides from a better paycheck, better benefits and 401K, I also get lots of PTO.  That led to my biggest trip so far in the year, a drive to Walla Walla, Washington, where I visited the area and beyond, with the biggest prize at the end, the mesmerizing Palouse Falls.  Walla Walla was a nice charming little town with lots of shops, wineries and surrounding views of the mountains, but Palouse Falls, and the drive up to there was amazing in itself, with the funky Palouse hills that looked like another planet.  It was a fun trip overall, and made easier thanks to PTO.</p>

		<h4>I'm an IBMer!</h4>
</div>

<p>Another highlight has been my evolving programming skills, including this blog page.  I've made projects out of Ruby on Rails and various JavaScript techniques, along with converting this blog page through Jekyll.  I'm working on a project made from Ember.js, a lot of fun with that one.  Stay tuned.  I've also found a niche with my writing.  I'm able to express myself more freely and happily.  I particularly like the live blog posts I did for Kobe's last game and the NBA Draft.  Those to me are where I'm at my best, since I'm thinking on my toes to keep up.</p>

<p>Of course, the first half of the year contains my favorite day of the year, May 10, a.k.a. my birthday.  I took the day off from work, which I can now do without worrying about not getting paid, and like many of my birthdays, the weather was perfect!  I spent the day with my Mom in Hood River, my favorite hip town along the Columbia River Gorge.  For lunch, my Mom and I went to pFriem, a brewery along the riverfront.  The lunch was perfect, along with all the beers we tried.  I enjoyed the Belgian Strong Dark and Pêche.  My Mom really found her liking for Saisons, the Black Saison and Lemon Saison. Now my Mom talks about nothing but Saisons with beer.  I love it!  To me, that's the best part of it all.  After a nice trip to Hood River, taking pictures with my Olloclip I received for my birthday, and getting a pFriem t-shirt with the bear cheering Op Uw Gezondheid, we headed back home before having a nice dinner at Decarli with my sister and Dad.  I love my birthday, no matter how old I'm getting, and as an added bonus, my co-workers decorated my desk and gave me a birthday card.  Yippee!</p>

</div>

<p>The first half of the year has also been good to my family.  My Mom had a successful event for Shir Tikvah called Shirlandia.  The people there just loved it!  She called it her best event ever.  I didn't go, but much praise to my Mom and the great work she does for Shir Tikvah.  Hearing all these people talk great about my Mom makes me a proud son.  My Dad has been hard at work too for Steam Engineering.  His hard work and dedication helped them get a big client, Harry's Fresh Foods.  I'm glad for my Dad.  Now if they can only catch that a**hole Dave, my Dad will be really good.  And how can I forget about my wonderful sister Jenn, whose work as a stay-at-home coder for PBS West continues to impress her bosses wherever they are.  Jenn's come a long way from her unhappy days at her old job and continues to amaze me with her knowledge of medical terminology and radiology skills.  Having my family happy makes me even happier.</p>

<p>I've having a great year so far, despite the rocky start.  I feel good about myself and know that this is only the beginning for me.  I have plenty of stuff planned for the latter half of the year and I'm feeling great!  I hope all of you reading this are great as well.  Life is good!</p>
