<p> 2016 has been a big year for a**holes.  Certain people purposely act like a**holes to destroy the very fabric of society for their own personal gain.  Others act like a**holes sorely for the attention.  And of course, there are plenty of people who do stupid things and end up being a**sholes as a consequence.  Of course, in order to be an a**hole, you must be around to know that you're an a**shole.  Those who die being an a**hole don't qualify.  With that said, here is my list of biggest a**holes of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> FBI Director James Comey, the guy who stole from the brother of late Nebraska Punter Sam Foltz's home, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, white-supremacist Steve Bannon, the Duckbill vandals, 'rapper' Lil' Yachty, Maine Governor Paul LePage, Vice-President Elect Mike Pence, Former congressman Anthony Weiner, Charleston shooter Dylann Roof, R&amp;B singer Drake, Twitter whores Azaelia Banks and Milo Yiannopoulos, white supremacist Richard Spencer, KKK loser David Duke, University of Alabama head coach Nick Saban, North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un, Hot Car Dad Justin Ross Harris, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, all genuine Donald Trump supporters.</p>

    </div>
    <h3>15. Grayson Allen</h3>
    <p>The star point guard of the Duke basketball team sure knows how to become a villain, as he’s become well known for intentionally tripping basketball players.  After his third trip against Elon (did he really need to trip a player from a small school), Duke finally disciplined him, suspending him indefinitely.  If only Mike Krzyzewski would have taken the time to discipline him earlier instead of going after Oregon guard Dillon Brooks after Duke’s season ended in the Sweet Sixteen last year, none of this might have happened this year. </p>

    </div>
    <h3>14. Julian Assange</h3>
    <p>Mr. WikiLeaks claims he leaked classified info because people have a right to know all information known to mankind, but Assange is nothing more than a partisan hack, being pawned by the Russian government to do their dirty work.  There’s nothing legal nor right about stealing people’s private information and releasing it to the public.  Assange is the lowest of the low, and has done little to prove his point.  Instead, as the messenger, he’s controlled by the real hackers who have an agenda.  Way to be stupid Assange.</p>

    <h3>13. Kanye West</h3>
    <p>What a fuckin' blowhard he is.  Kanye West makes all these ridiculously obnoxious statements and goes on all these stupid rants, it makes people forget he even makes music in the first place.  His music has completely fallen off, but I can't even buy his album The Life of Pablo because he started the stupid streaming-only trend for hip-hop albums.  But who cares about his music anyways.  Possibly the only man more narcissistic than Donald Trump, Kanye took the time to praise him and then went into a hospital.  I’ll listen to his old music, but now he’s just pathetic.</p>

</div>
<h3>12. Kellyanne Conway</h3>
<p>The definition of a complete bitch, Kellyanne Conway had the very tough task of making Donald Trump seem like a caring person, which he is clearly not.  It didn't matter how ridiculous Donald Trump was acting, Kellyanne Conway acted like he didn't do anything wrong at all and played the deflect game to the extreme, acting completely oblivious to the fact that Donald Trump said something racist and bigoted while pushing some alternative reasoning that clearly wasn't the main point of said argument.  And for someone who could care less about minorities being victims of hate-crimes, Conway managed to take the time and complain about the death threats she received.  Selfish!</p>

<h3>11. Aaron &amp; Melissa Klein</h3>
<p>This story should have been resolved by now, but the loser homophobes keep complaining about their right to discriminate against gays and lesbians, which isn’t an actual right in the business world.  Their attitude towards their shameful act and subsequent actions is extremely Un-Christian, from leaking the lesbian couple's personal information online to claiming to be broke despite all the money they’ve received from stupid minded saps like themselves.  There’s a big difference between the right to believe something and the right to enforce your views on someone else, yet Christian lunatics like the Kleins fail to see that.  They need to pay the fine, stop their legal bullshit and go away; clearly, they are in the wrong business and the wrong state.</p>

<h3>10. Kevin Durant</h3>
<p>Kevin Durant went from being the most liked superstar to one of the most hated by leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder to join the Western Conference champs, the Golden State Warriors, proving that 'if you can’t beat them, join them.'  Plenty of people thought Durant was determined to win a Championship on his own and not followed LeBron's route, but sadly, Durant is just like everyone else, desperate to win at all costs.  These super-teams are making the NBA quality deteriorate and Durant is part of the problem.  Thankfully we have players like Russell Westbrook who know a thing or two about loyalty.</p>

</div>
<h3>9. John Stumpf</h3>
<p>The now former CEO of Wells Fargo fell from grace after Wells Fargo’s long standing and disgusting practices of signing customers up for phony accounts without their approval to rack up money on fees became public.  Wells Fargo got slapped a large fine by the CFPB, but it’s not nearly large enough.  Their business practices and unrealistic sales goals are the reason why big banks are so reviled and greedy big shots like Stumpf never seem to get punished.  It’s always the low-level employees being forced to do this that got punished, and those who tried to report the unethical behavior who got fired for doing the right thing.  They wouldn’t even let their employees use the bathroom...One thing is for sure, I’m glad I don’t work for Wells Fargo.</p>

<h3>8. Terri Moulton</h3>
<p>Will Terri Moulton ever go away?  It's been six years since Kyron Horman went missing, and the last person to see him is still desperate to live the normal life she doesn't deserve.  Of course, living a normal life doesn't include interviewing with People and Dr. Phil with phony sob stories in a clear attempt for money.  Nor does it involve stolen gun, domestic violence and stolen car charges in a span of a year.  She obviously knows something about Kyron Horman and they really need to find him.  If they could get the scumbag who kidnapped and killed Jacob Wetterling to fess up after 27 years, they can certainly find something to get her to finally tell the truth.</p>

<h3>7. Vladimir Putin</h3>
<p>All hail glorious dictator Vladimir Putin, who bullies his way into doing whatever he wants to do.  Fortunately for him (and unfortunate for us Americans), he managed to find a sucker in the United States to do his dirty work, Mr. Donald Trump, who thinks Putin is a great leader and making mincemeat of President Obama.  Putin is nothing more than a big bully who craves power and silences all opposition.  That’s not quality leadership, that’s pure dictatorship, and with Putin eager to make a mess of our election, it’s obvious that he and his Russian goons will do anything to get what they want.  We know they hacked into the Democrats emails.  Vladimir Putin is pure evil and Donald Trump is sucking at his teat because he’s stupid. </p>

<h3>6. Ryan Lochte</h3>
<p>US Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte had a lot going for him, but one night in Rio, he and three other swimmers acted stupidly and probably had too much to drink when they for no reason vandalized a gas station bathroom.  None of this wouldn’t have been as bad if Lochte and the other three hadn't made the false claim of being robbed at gunpoint.  Video evidence proved them wrong and now Ryan Lochte and pals have to live with the lie they stupidly created.</p>

<h3>5. Brock Turner</h3>
<p>A former swimmer from Stanford University who violently raped an unconscious woman, yet insists the only mistake he made was drink too much that night, Brock Turner is the epitome of a privileged brat who thinks the law’s above him.  Even worse, the Judge in his case gave him a slap on the wrist, ending up with three months in prison, because the Judge felt protecting him was more important than the victim.</p>

<h3>4. Citizens for Constitutional Freedom</h3>
<p>The militiamen became infamous early in 2016 when they took over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, spending 40 days before the FBI arrested them.  These clowns are nothing more than anti-government whack-jobs who just want money and freedom to do whatever they want without any consequences.  The antics of these men, especially the leadership of the Bundy Dimwits, showcase just how hypocritical and stupid they are.  Do these losers even remember the two men that they claimed they were fighting for in the first place?  But yet, these losers were acquitted of all charges, by clueless jurors who gave them the right to enter government property and hold it hostage for an indefinite period of time in the name of protest.  They wouldn’t even convict them of having guns on federal property even though they recorded themselves with guns on federal property.  Pathetic.  Yet the Native Americans protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota have been treated far worse for doing far less.</p>

		<h4>Pat McCrory</h4>
</div>
<h3>3. Pat McCrory</h3>
<p> The worst kind of Governor, a religious lunatic with no grasp of reality and an appetite for vengeance.  Pat McCrory set off a big firestorm with the single worst piece of legislation ever written: HB2, a homophobic bill preventing transgenders from using their preferred bathrooms (amongst other things).  Claiming transgenders aren’t real and merely sexual predators after children, Pat McCrory is clueless and bigoted, willing to crush North Carolina’s economy for his war on bathroom use.  Even worse, his defense for passing the bill was that the city of Charlotte overreached their boundaries by giving LGBT human rights, creating this disastrous bill in about a day, while claiming he can’t get rid of it as quickly.  Fortunately, he won’t be on this list next year, as he lost his reelection race, but the damage is done, and McCrory and his Republican friends in the state will do everything they can to control their state without a damn of the majority of voters.

</div>
<h3>2. Ted Cruz</h3>
<p>Ted Cruz is the worst Senator since Joseph McCarthy, perhaps the worst senator ever.  He's never given a crap about anything but himself. So of course, he ran for President, the first major candidate in.  During that time, Ted Cruz did his typical hate filled routine, complete with religious garbage, lie after lie after lie, and rivaled Donald Trump toe to toe in making outrageously pathetic statements made for Reality TV.  But the only saving grace is that only one loser would win the nomination, and Ted Cruz wasn't it.  The best thing about this loser was his horrible speech at the RNC, which hopefully will lead to his downfall.  Plus for someone who loves freedom, he has no clue what freedom actually is, essentially arguing the Federal Government should cease to exist...except for banning abortions and LGBT rights, of course. In any other year, he'd be by far the worst Presidential candidate, but 2016 is obviously a special year for a**holes.</p>

<h3>1. Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Thanks for ruining America Donald Trump.  Why anyone would be stupid enough to actually think the most narcissistic man in the planet would actually want to help people with their problems?  It's a shame he's been given the keys to do what he wants with America and divide it for his personal gain.  I already miss the days of having a President who actually represents all Americans, rather than siding with our enemies over the majority of Americans. FDT.</p>
