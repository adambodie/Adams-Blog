<p> 2016 is over, and it couldn't have ended any sooner.  2016 has been the year that the world has completely turned stupid.  Common sense and respect have been thrown out of the window in favor of hate and extremism.  But there's hope for those who feel like the world has lost its way.  For me, it's self-determination and aiming for the best.  Here's the second half of my year in review.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">
		<img src="/img/adam.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Adam" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>I've won this year.</h4>
</div>

<p>Ironically, I end the year just as I started it; sick with a bug.  Not a particularly bad bug, but still battling something.  There are worse things in the world than a minor virus, and I'm thankful for that.  But at the same time, it's no fun, especially knowing you have responsibilities in this world.  That's a part of life.</p>

<p>I got my first full week of vacation off of work in July, and I lived it up, driving down to Reno and spending a few days there.  What a wonderful trip.  Being in the fun lights of Reno, the beautiful and stunning Lake Tahoe, the majestic Burney Falls, the volcanic Lava Beds National Monument, all the views of Mt. Shasta I could see, and everything else I saw down there made me feel alive.  What a rush!  One of the highlights of my year, and well deserved from all the hard work I put in.</p>

<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/reno.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Reno" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>Reno was lots of fun</h4>
</div>

<p>I continue to work at Seterus, having just reached my 18th month there.  I'm glad of my personal milestone, and I'm proud of myself for sticking with it and proving my worth.  It also feels good to be appreciated for the effort.  I even got a slight raise for market value reasons, but a raise is better than a pay cut.  Of course, I'm still focused on developing, learning new things every day.  I hope next year is the year I start working on reaching my ultimate goal and taking it to the next step, but until then, I'm still hungry, still strong and still determined to live my dreams.</p>

<p>I've also made incredible progress finding out my family roots I never knew about.  I knew my Mom's maternal side came from modern day Lithuania, but with my research, I found the exact area they hailed from, Suwalki.  Incredible stuff to find out, and pretty neat knowing that someone who once lived here came to the United States, and that it lead to my existence.  And for my love of all things Minnesota, I learned that my Mom's mystery paternal side largely came from Winona, Minnesota.  Who knew that when I went to Winona ten years ago that I would in the land of some of my lineage.  I always knew I had some Minnesota in me; now I know why.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Lake Winona</h4>
</div>

<p>But there has been some down moments this year.  The Oregon Ducks had a bad football season, finishing 4-8 and now have a new coach, Willie Taggart.  Hopefully the Ducks will be better next season.  At least the Minnesota Golden Gophers finished 9-4 with a win in the Holiday Bowl to end the season.  The Minnesota Vikings started 5-0, but were decimated by injuries to the offensive line.  As it is, they're 7-8 and will miss the playoffs.  And of course, the Los Angeles Lakers, fresh off the Kobe era, have been decent this year with new coach Luke Walton and their young talents.  The future looks bright for the Lakers.</p>
<p>The biggest embarrassment of the this year, without a doubt, is living in a country where Donald Trump could steal a Presidential election by appealing solely to the lowest of the low, acting like a complete jerk, and his continuing praise of all things Russia, who committed cyberattacks against the Democrats.  Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but of course, democracy is rigged towards the hateful extremists known as the Republican party.  What a shame, America.  It's every person for themselves, and no, he will never be my President.</p>
