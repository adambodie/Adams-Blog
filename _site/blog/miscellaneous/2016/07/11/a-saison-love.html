<p> When I was young, I only saw beer in black and white.  Obviously, I didn't drink beer, but my Mom occasionally drank beer, mainly when we went to the Oak Hills Brewpub, where she ordered the dark beers, the Porters and Stouts.  From then, I considered good beers to be dark, while crap beers like Bud, Miller and Coors as the bad beers.  It wasn't until I was 26 that I decided to try beer for the first time, as McMenamins on Allen and Murray. I had a sampler of dark and light beers, mainly interested in the Black Rabbit Porter and Terminator Stout.  From then on, I found myself trying all styles of beers, dark and light, where I learned there's more than just BMC crap (Bud-Miller-Coors for the uninformed).</p>

</div>
<p>My mom though, was a tough cookie to crack to see the other side of beers.  She loved her Porters and Stouts, and with me drinking beer, we took the opportunity to have more beer.  But on a hot summer day on July 15, 2012 at the Raccoon Lodge, my Mom asked me what type of beer I had ordered and asked if she could taste it.  Naturally, I let her sample me beer of choice that night, the Saison Fume, and she was intrigued by it.  The seeds were set, and going out to Hood River for my birthday, we went to pFriem, a Belgian-style brewery along the waterfront. We sampled six beers, which I picked for myself, but my Mom found herself really loving two of the beers I picked.  They were both Saisons, a Black Saison and Lemon Saison.  Suddenly, I found a way to break through that black and white beer bubble.  Ever since, she's been fascinated with Saisons, perfect for the summertime.  So here are my thoughts on Saisons and why they are the perfect craft beer for all people.</p>
<p>The first Saison I tried was Great Divide Brewing Company's Collette, which stands out as one of the best readily available Saisons in these parts of the United States.  I immediately took a liking to it and was impressed with its light yet fruity/earthy/spiced tones to it.  To me, that's what makes a Saison an easy drinking craft beer.  On the one hand, you have the overly hoppy IPA's, which plenty of American's love, but they are admittedly not an easy style of beer to get into right away.  It took me a while to appreciate the hops.  On the other side of light beers is the bready floral Pilsner beers which the crappy BMC beers resemble lightly.  Saisons, a Belgian summer beer, doesn't quite have the hops (since Belgians don't like their beers hoppy) but also have a more robust flavor (not like Pilsners at all).</p>
<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">
		<img src="/img/tank-7.jpg" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale" class="image block img-responsive" />
		<h4>I vote Tank 7 as the best Saison I've had.</h4>
</div>
<p>Another great Saison I would highly recommend, one that's also year-round in these parts, is Boulevard Brewing's Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale.  Of course, Farmhouse Ale is another term for Saison, so please keep that in mind.  In terms of Saison's for the masses across America, there aren't that many, mostly made by breweries during the spring-summer months.  It's unfortunate there aren't more readily available Saison's but with Collette and Tank 7, those to me are enough to get me by.  I do have to admit I have never tried a real Belgian Saison made in Belgium.  I know there is the Saison Dupont that's considered the best.  I may have to seek that one out since I got my mom on the Saison-train.</p>
<p>Living in Oregon, the hop capital of the United States, it isn't that surprising that Saisons get overlooked, again, only appearing as spring-summer seasonals for those who don't always stick to the script.  But there are specialty breweries that focus on specialty beer types, like Cascade Brewing's focus on the Sour Beer market.  Luckily, for Saison fans, there's Logsdon Farmhouse Ales in Hood River, which as the name suggests, offers plenty of Saisons and other Belgian beers.  I've only had one of their beers, the Seizoen Bretta, they are on the more expensive side and come in wine-bottle size, but I can assure you that Seizoen Bretta was quite delicious and worth the money.  I bought it as an anniversary beer, but for the life of me, can't remember what anniversary it was.</p>
<div class="blog-pic">

		<h4>Seizoen Bretta, a Brett-alicious Saison</h4>
</div>
<p>As a final note, I'd like to share what I consider to be the most interesting part of Saisons, Brett.  No, it has nothing to do with my Uncle, but Saisons with Brett are considered to be especially enjoyable and intriguing.  Who exactly is Brett?  It's short for Brettanomyces, a special kind of yeast that's found in Belgian beers that gives it a particularly earthy taste.  During my young research on Saisons, I always heard about Brett; which is why I sought out the Seizoen Bretta from Logsdon in the first place.  I hope anyone that likes Saisons or are just curious to seek about the Brett Saisons, or any Saison in general.  A perfect summer beer for those who like to be different, Saisons are often overshadowed by the hoppy IPAs and easily accessible Pilsners, but make a great choice for those looking for an easy to drink beer with complex fruity, earthy and spicy flavors. </p>
