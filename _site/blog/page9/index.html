  <h1>It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Basketball Year, a.k.a. March Madness</h1>

  <p class="intro">Selection Sunday has arrived and gone, and now March Madness is set to begin, as 68 teams enter the NCAA Tournament, only one will win the National Championship. Who will take down the nets? How many upsets will ruin people’s brackets everywhere? Which 12 seeds will pull off the upsets? And will this finally be the year a #1 seed loses to a 16th seed?</p>

  <h1>The Great Back Door Debate</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">February 25, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Back in December, a horrific attack occurred in San Bernardino from a husband and wife who supported ISIS. They were killed in a shootout, but yet another battle has raged. The FBI wants all the information on Syed Farook’s iPhone, but as it was encrypted with a password, they can’t get into it, for Apple’s security features erases the phone's data after 10 failed password attempts. Despite a Federal judge demanding Apple create a way to hack into the phone, Apple refuses to do so, believing everyone’s iPhone is at risk by creating such a back-door. Should Apple be forced to comply? Or is it better not to play with fire?</p>

  <h1>How the Republican Party has Completely lost its Mind</h1>

  <p class="intro">The Republican party used to be a fair party. I may have never liked them enough to vote for any of their past presidential candidates, it's become increasingly clear the Republican party has jumped off the deep end and completely lost it sense of reality. Gone are the days of true leadership, instead we have a bunch of crybaby lawless imbeciles who go completely out of their way to obstruct the government process and spend their time doing nothing but complaining until they get their way. Maybe one of these days, they will realize their constant complaining is hurting their party, but until then, they have nothing to show for it and never will.</p>

  <p class="intro">All Star Saturday Night has always been my favorite part of the All-Star Weekend. The All Star Game itself is fine and all, but it's too much of an exhibition game with no defense. Friday night, with the Rising Stars game, is much of the same. But Saturday Night, with the Three Point Contest and the Slam Dunk Contest, are for the fans.</p>

  <p class="intro">We're barely into the month of February and already we've seen not one, but two rather bizarre hip-hop beefs, the type you could never imagine ever existing. On the one hand, we have B.o.B. vs. famed Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and now we have Ghostface Killah vs. infamous pharmaceutical CEO Martin Shkreli (which has now involved the head of the Congressional Committee on Oversight and Government Reform). A rather odd consortium of characters, feuding over the most bizarre things. Whose beef is more odd? Here are my thoughts.</p>

  <h1>An Ode to Johnny Manziel, whose NFL Career has turned out EXACTLY how I thought it would</h1>

  <p class="intro">As a Minnesota Vikings fan, I watched the 2014 NFL Draft hoping for two things. One was that the Vikings would take a quarterback that would be their franchise quarterback, and the other was that they wouldn't wind up with Heisman winning Quarterback Johnny Manziel. The Vikings needed a quarterback, but Johnny Manziel was not only a terrible fit for the Vikings, but he was and is to this day, a party boy who wants to be a celebrity with little focus on the game.</p>

  <h1>Dumb and Dumber - Why the Top Republican Presidential Candidates Suck at Math</h1>

  	<span class="date">January 31, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Tomorrow is the official start of the 2016 Presidential Election process in the United States, with the Iowa Caucus deciding who becomes the first leader in the race. Although it's no guarantee the winner of the Iowa Caucus becomes the nominee (i.e Mike Huckabee in 2008 and Rick Santorum in 2012 on the Republican side), it does say something about each party in general. With all of that said, the top two ranked Republican candidates in Iowa, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have pushed the bounds on extremism and pure hatred. It's no wonder establish Republicans are actively concerned about these two winning the Republican nomination, as some Republicans are smarter than others.</p>

  <p class="intro">Does everyone know the song 'I Fought the Law,' with the famous lyrics, 'I fought the law, and the law won?' Good, it will help you get a better understand why Ammon Bundy and his terrorist militiamen friends will face a harsh reality now that they have been arrested for taking over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. After three weeks holding the place hostage, threatening to shoot law enforcement should they try to take them out, and leaving the people of Harney county scared, Ammon Bundy and his goons were finally arrested after 8 of them left to to attend a town meeting in the town of John Day.</p>

  <h1>Super Bowl 50 - Look at that Smile!</h1>

  <p class="intro">Super Bowl 50 is on its way, featuring a match-up of the NFL's top two defenses, the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers (1 and 2 respectively). The biggest headline will likely be the probable MVP this year, Carolina QB Cam Newton, a very talented but cocky player. There are quite a few people that find Cam Newton obnoxious and arrogant, whether it's his me-first attitude or his 'Dab' dancing whenever he scores a touchdown. But on the other hand, how can you hate someone with a smile like his?</p>

  <h1>White Privilege II - Why We Need a Conversation on Race</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">January 23, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Yesterday, the hip-hop game was jolted by the new song from Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, 'White Privilege II,' a vicious track almost nine minutes long that discusses racism in the hip-hop world, in general, the Black Lives Matter movement, and how 'White America' is at an advantage as opposed to minorities. Though this is not the first time Macklemore has discussed racism in his music; the original White Privilege was a song he released back in 2005, now that Macklemore is famous worldwide, the platform is expanded exponentially with his fame, social media and a generation of racism sensitivity. Therefore, more people have a say than they did in 2005, when Macklemore was just a starving underground rapper from Seattle that until his unprecedented rise to fame, represented a city whose only taste of mainstream success was Sir Mix-a-Lot and his butt loving song Baby Got Back. While Macklemore will never understand what it's like to actually be a black person (something he is completely aware with), this track is important nonetheless as we will never get past racism without talking about it.</p>
