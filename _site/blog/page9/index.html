  <h1>Donald Trump - Master Manipulator</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 23, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Next year, the United States will elect a new president to lead our country.  We have many candidates to choose from.  Unfortunately, politics, campaigns and spending bring out lots of ugly, negative comments, childish bickering and aiming for the lowest common denominator attempts to attract voters.  Not surprisingly, one candidate stands out in this department, a man obsessed with himself, always trying to gain attention by any means necessary, and a firm believer of 'no news is bad new,'  That man of course, is a man famous for building a rich empire and starring in reality TV shows, Donald Trump.</p>

  <h1>USC - My Anti-Christ</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 21, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Today marks another edition of Oregon vs. USC.  This should be just another game.  But for me, I consider myself the unofficial President of the 'I Hate USC' Club, perhaps just the President of the Portland Chapter of the 'I Hate USC' Club.  It shouldn't have to be this way, but yet I passionately hate USC more than any football program in college sports.  Not schools like Oregon State and Washington, nor schools like Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan, rival schools of Oregon (where I started) and Minnesota (where I graduated).  But yet, it's USC that makes me puke the most.  With apologies to my Uncle Fred and cousin Kimmy, two USC graduates who actually show me love and respect (even from afar), here's a time-line of my hatred for USC.</p>

  <h1>Don't Let Xenophobia Ruin Your Life</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 19, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">There are plenty of people who are afraid of people who aren't like them, and it makes me sick to read.  Diversity is one of the greatest things about the United States.  We have lots of ethnicities, religions, identities, etc.  I, for one, am proud to be an American that accepts all races, religions, etc.  We need to embrace others, not fear those who are not like us.</p>

  <h1>Why Tracy Claeys is the Right Choice for the Golden Gophers</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 11, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Two weeks ago, Jerry Kill, the football coach of the Gophers, retired due to health concerns.  It seemed as if Minnesota would plummet to mediocrity yet again.  But despite the loss of Kill, the program made leaps and bounds in terms of success, fan appreciation and continuity while he was there.  Fanfare was much higher than it was when I went there in 2006, with JerrySota becoming a common phrase for Gopher fans.  They had two choices: Keep things the way it was and retain trusty defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys as its coach, or go in a different direction.  Choosing continuity over uncertainty, Minnesota made the right choice to keep Claeys as Head Coach.</p>

  <h1>Confessions of an Online Stalker Part 2</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 9, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Four years ago, I set out to write an article on Innocent Online Stalking.  The results of the article were quite fascinating.  I met a young woman named Jennifer Bodie and asked her about her online stalking.  She described in length how it affected her and why she did it.  I decided to do a follow up to check in with Jenn and see if she's still doing it.</p>

  <h1>The 2015-2016 Los Angeles Lakers - One week in the Season</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 5, 2015</span></p>
  <p class="intro">One week into the season, the Lakers are winless (0-4) and have not looked impressive as a whole.  Am I that surprised?  Of course not.  Does the Lakers future look bright?  I'd say yeah, not this year, but a couple years down the road, the Lakers will be contending again.</p>

  <p class="intro">Welcome to Bodie Web Design 2.0, the Express Edition.  As you will see on my web page, I have updated my initial version of Bodie Web Design by using Express as a web framework.  So why use Express (or any web framework) instead of just plain HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript.  The answer is simple: It's easier (if you know how to use it).</p>
