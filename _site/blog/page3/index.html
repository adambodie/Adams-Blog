  <h1>RNC vs. DNC - Two Different Worlds</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">July 31, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">The Republican and Democrat National Conventions have come and gone, officially ending the Primaries.  Seeing bits of each, I can safely say one thing: the two Parties are from two different worlds. One filled with anger and hate, the other filled with love and passion.  So which one better reflects us as a nation?  Here are my thoughts on each convention and my allegiance going forward.</p>

  <h1>Donald Trump, Vice President of Russia?</h1>

  <p class="intro">Last week, just before the Democratic National Convention started, hackers released emails from the DNC pertaining to their head’s plans to push candidate Bernie Sanders out of the race.  The hacks were deemed by U.S. officials as likely the work of the Russians, perhaps in an attempt to sway the election towards Republican Donald Trump.  Now, Donald Trump himself has asked Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton’s emails and release them.  Clearly, Donald Trump prefers Russia over Democrats in the United States.  A man who has repeatedly praised Russia President Vladimir Putin as a great leader and capable of ‘getting stuff done,’ one question remains.  Is Donald Trump working to become President of the United States or the Vice President of Russia?</p>

  <h1>Pokemon Whoa!</h1>

  <p class="intro">For the past two weeks, I've heard the most bizarre stories, all relating to the new super-viral video game that has seemingly taken over the world, Pokemon Go.  Pokemon first hit the scene 20 years ago, but this game allows people to try to 'catch-em all' based on real-world locations, getting people out and about just to catch Pokemon on their game.  It's led to some bizarre stories; people catching criminals, getting stabbed by others, finding dead bodies, guns, etc., getting in car accidents, taking up police parking, fire parking, and other bizarre warnings all over Pokemon Go.  I played the original Pokemon games when I was a teenager, but now we're seeing adults playing the game; it's pure madness, all these ridiculous real-life events happening based solely on this game.  Imagine what else this game can lead to.  Here's a list of five things I wish this game could find.</p>

  <h1>A Saison Love</h1>

  <p class="intro">When I was young, I only saw beer in black and white.  Obviously, I didn't drink beer, but my Mom occasionally drank beer, mainly when we went to the Oak Hills Brewpub, where she ordered the dark beers, the Porters and Stouts.  From then, I considered good beers to be dark, while crap beers like Bud, Miller and Coors as the bad beers.  It wasn't until I was 26 that I decided to try beer for the first time, as McMenamins on Allen and Murray. I had a sampler of dark and light beers, mainly interested in the Black Rabbit Porter and Terminator Stout.  From then on, I found myself trying all styles of beers, dark and light, where I learned there's more than just BMC crap (Bud-Miller-Coors for the uninformed).</p>

  <h1>Enough is Enough</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">July 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Enough is enough.  For so long, our country has turned a blind eye on racism, proclaiming that it's not a big deal like it used to be, just because of Civil Rights and the elimination of Jim Crow laws.  But recent events, particularly the deaths of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota and the deaths of five police officers in Dallas have shown just how horrific racism in the United States really is.  Is there a coincidence that this is happening now at this current time?  Of course not.  This is a by-product of the anger and race baiting politics that Donald Trump has shoved down America's throats.</p>

  <h1>Donald The Racist Ugly Misogynistic Pig</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">July 7, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">In an election where Donald Trump has seemingly offended just about everyone that's not an old white Christian, it was only inevitable that Donald Trump would be accused of Anti-Semitism.  With all the Islamophobia Donald Trump keeps spreading, it's hard to forget that the Jews have historically been hated on by the majority of non-Jews.  Recently, Donald Trump tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton with money in the background and a Star of David symbol proclaiming  'Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.'  Trump took it down two hours later and replaced it with a circle replacing the Jewish Star.  Does this make Donald Trump Anti-Semitic or just plain stupid.  Here are my thoughts on Trump's history of Anti-Semitism.</p>

  <p class="intro">We've reached the end of June, which essentially means we're halfway through the year.  I've had a successful year so far, and I'm aiming to continue that with an even better second half of the year.  So here's to me, but also to those who have supported me along the way, because I wouldn't be the person I am without the loving support of my family and friends.</p>

  <p class="intro">I wasn't going to say anything about the global phenomenon known stupidly as 'Brexit,' it doesn't really affect me personally since I don't live in the United Kingdom.  It's really an issue out of my league.  But after seeing the English soccer team lose an epic upset to Iceland in Euro 2016, I've decided to say a few words based solely so I can use the following joke: England just brexited Euro 2016.  The timing couldn't be any better.  Here are my thoughts on Brexit.</p>

  <p class="intro"><strong>4:32 pm - </strong>Tonight is the 2016 NBA Draft, where the young stars join their new teams.  For my team, the Lakers, with the number 2 pick, hope to pick their next star...just like they did last year with D'Angelo Russell.  While Russell wasn't an immediate superstar, only time will tell if he lives up to the hype.  Who will the Lakers take with the number 2 picks.  All signs point to Duke forward Brandon Ingram, but the Lakers pick will be announced in 10 minutes.</p>

  <p class="intro">I was asked to compare two recent movies and Oscar nominated and winning movies from this years Academy Awards.
