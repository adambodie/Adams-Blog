  <h1>College Football Week Eight Thoughts</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 22, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Eight is unofficially Homecoming Week.  For Minnesota, it's their official Homecoming game against Rutgers, their first matchup ever.  For Oregon, it's a painful reminder of how far they've truly fallen against another high powered offensive team in Cal.  That game was played yesterday.  As we reach Week 8, a closer picture starts for determining the four playoff teams.  I'll talk more about that later.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Seven Thoughts</h1>

  	<span class="date">October 15, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Seven for me is Strange Week.  The Minnesota Golden Gophers make their way to Maryland to play them for the first time since they joined the Big Ten in 2014.  I'm still not used to them and Rutgers being part of the Big Ten.  Maryland should've remained in the ACC and Rutgers looks like complete crap.  Market aside, the Big Ten should've stopped with Nebraska.  But nonetheless, it's the game against the Terrapins.  As for the Ducks, they stand to have their best defensive performance of the season, as they have the week off.  As for the rest of the week, it seems kind of bland, with the exception of Alabama-Tennessee and Ohio State-Wisconsin.</p>

  <h1>Why I Should Be The Next Starting Quarterback of the Cleveland Browns</h1>

  <p class="intro">Tim Couch, Ty Detmer, Doug Pederson, Spergon Wynn, Kelly Holcomb, Jeff Garcia, Luke McCown, Trent Dilfer, Charlie Frye, Derek Anderson, Brady Quinn, Ken Dorsey, Bruce Gradkowski, Colt McCoy, Jake Delhomme, Seneca Wallace, Brandon Weeden, Thad Lewis, Jason Campbell, Brian Hoyer, Johnny Manziel, Connor Shaw, Josh McCown, Austin Davis, Robert Griffin III and Cody Kessler.	A list this long would be perfect to describe a proud NFL franchise's Hall of Famers, but no, this is the list of starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns since their franchise was reborn in 1998.  Clearly, the Cleveland Browns are cursed with Quarterbacks.  They're looking for the wrong qualities. Here are the reasons I should be the next starting quarterback of the Cleveland Browns.</p>

  <h1>So He Finally Used the A-Word</h1>

  <p class="intro">It took sixteen months, but the Idiot finally used the A-word he never likes to use: <strong>APOLOGIZE</strong>.  What did it take for him to apologize?  A video mic drop recording of him saying some incredibly vulgar things about women, essentially bragging about hitting on a married woman and getting away with groping women because he’s a star.  He called it 'locker room banter,' I call it 'words a sexual predator would say.'  Now that he's used the A-word, he can now apologize to everyone he’s offended in his life.  Here's an partial list of everyone owed an apology.  He's offended so many people it's hard to keep track.</p>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Six for me is Rivalry Week Part 1.  Minnesota hosted Iowa for the Floyd of Rosedale and Oregon hosted Washington, winning twelve in a row against them but looking far worse now than they have at ay time in those twelve years.  As for the the rest of the games, another entertaining variety of match-ups.</p>

  <h1>Sorry Norf Norf Lady</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">October 6, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Recently, I read about a viral video of a Christian woman, a mother of four, who blogged her video reaction upon listening to a rap song she heard on the radio, rapping the song line by line and getting upset over the lyrics.  The song in question, Norf Norf, by Vince Staples, is a typical example of a gangsta rap song.  Not surprisingly, the woman was quite offended that this song would appear on the radio, proclaiming the songs of the old days are better for kids.  Not surprisingly, that is simply not true, and there is far more to the story than what appears on the surface.</p>

  <p class="intro">Week Five has plenty of great matchups, with three top ten conference battles for the first time: Stanford at Washington on Friday, Wisconsin at Michigan and Louisville at Clemson.  Meanwhile, it's the battle for the Governor's Victory Bell for Minnesota as they went to Penn State, while Oregon, after a demoralizing loss last week, head to Washington State, where they hope to avoid last years dysentery affected loss to Washington State</p>

  <h1>Liar Liar, Pant is on Fire</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 26, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">People lie, doesn't matter who you are.  But some people lie more than others.  This year, lying has become the new truth-telling, as the Republican candidate for President, whose name won't be mentioned, lies about, well, basically everything.  This is coming from a man who believes it's okay to lie and does so repeatedly and often as possible.  A man so deluded in himself that he complains a mass conspiracy every time someone tells him what he's saying is lying.  He even claims Ted Cruz as the biggest liar of all time with the nickname Lyin' Ted (to be fair, they are both ridiculous liars). With that said, tonight is the first Presidential debate, and one thing is for certain: this Idiot will frequently lie.  If a drinking game would be made out of it, all participants would die of alcohol poisoning. Here's a live look at lie upon lie upon lie..</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Four Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 25, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football.</p>

  <h1>Who Killed JonBenét?</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 24, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Twenty years ago, the night after Christmas, six year old JonBenét Ramsey was found murdered in her home, in what has become a bizarre and fascinating case, from the rambling ransom note to the suspicion on the family, there are many odd things about the case that makes it unusual.  Yet after 20 years, no one really knows what happened.  Recently, a new investigator team, with new technology, reanalyzed the evidence and discussed their findings on a CBS special.  So with that all said, who killed JonBenét Ramsey?  Here are all my possible theories, complete with their likelihood of it happening.</p>
