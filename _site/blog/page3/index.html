  <h1>Worst Politicians Currently in Office</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 15, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Let's be honest, politics is dumb at its core and politicians are terrible.  Currently, Congress has an approval rating of about 10% or so.  Plenty of our current politicians couldn't figure their way out of a paper bag, much less pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation.  No matter who's elected President, Congress will always find ways to screw things up and stop real progress from happening.  With that said, here are the 15 worst members of Congress, and as an added bonus, the 5 worst Governors.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Two Thoughts</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 10, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On paper, Week Two looked to be the worst weekend of college football ever.  No ranked teams facing each other, more ranked teams playing FCS weaklings than fellow Power 5 teams, and just one ranked team on the road, #13 Louisville playing at Syracuse in an ACC Showdown.  But life has plenty of surprises, as Week 2 provided more entertainment than on paper.  Week 3 promises to be better in terms of quality matchups, but here are my thoughts on what happened in Week 2.</p>

  <h1>Nature Deserves Respect Too</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On August 29th, a group of idiots, believing they can do whatever they want without any repercussions, destroyed a famous rock at Cape Kiwanda known as Duckbill.  Fortunately, someone recorded them committing the act and confronted them over it.  But the damage was done, all because some idiots couldnâ€™t read a sign and blamed everyone but themselves for something that was obviously avoidable.  Too many people take nature for granted, and it deserves every bit of respect it gets.</p>

  <h1>NFL Preview</h1>

  <p class="intro">As further proof of the seasons changing, the NFL season is about to start, with a Thursday night rematch of Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos vs. the Carolina Panthers.  It should be an exciting year in the NFL, with a lot of notable events in the offseason and plenty of more on the way.  Which team will surprise this year?  Which team will disappoint this year?  Who wins the MVP?  Here's my thoughts on the NFL season on the horizon.</p>

  <p class="intro">Thank god football's back.  It's refreshing to take interest in something besides politics and this ridiculous election.  Week One is under wraps, and though only a handful of games carry any value, it's only the beginning.  Here's my thoughts.</p>

  <h1>Kaepernicking 2.0 - The Protest Edition</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">August 30, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Last Friday, during a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers, Quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the National Anthem, taking the opportunity to protest racial oppression in the United States, and plans to continue his protest until 'real change' progresses.  Reaction has not surprisingly been mixed, with some praising him for taking a stand while others are criticizing him for it.  Kaepernick is not the first athlete to use his status to protest civil rights, nor will he be the last, but the question remains, will his refusal to stand actually bring any change?</p>

  <h1>If It Sounds Like A Racist...</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">August 28, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Last week, the Governor of Maine, Paul LePage, known for being an obnoxious blubber mouth, bluntly stated that 90% plus of all drug dealers arrested in Maine are "Black and Hispanic," a statement which many found to be abhorrently racist.  After all, this is the same Governor who earlier in the year proclaimed that drug dealers "are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty; these types of guys, they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road."  Clearly, these types of comments, focusing on skin color, are profoundly racist in nature, lumping blacks with drugs and street-names.  Yet Paul LePage, angry that Democratic State Rep. Drew Gattine allegedly called him racist, left him a vulgar voicemail demanding proof of his 'racism,' using multiple swear words against him, including cocksucker, and told him, "I am after you," amongst other things.  It would be one thing to say something once, but people like Paul LePage have repeatedly made racist comments.  So what do incidents like this say about racism in our society?</p>

  <p class="intro">Next week is the unofficial start of the College Football season, and after a boring summer filled with boring baseball, I'm ready for some football.  Although it officially started 'last night' when Cal played Hawaii halfway around the world in Sydney, Australia, next week is the start for the rest of us. As someone who spent three years at the University of Oregon and one and a half years at the University of Minnesota, I have two teams to follow, and as long as they don't play each other, I don't have to decide.  So here are my thoughts on the upcoming football season.</p>

  <h1>My New Family Roots</h1>

  	<span class="date">August 25, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">For many years, my Mom has been on a quest to find her family roots, never knowing who her biological father was.  Recently, a DNA test found my Mom with 47% European Jewish, 34% Great Britain and 16% other.  I've always wanted to know about my family roots as well, and with my Mom's interest, I was able was able to dig deeper than before to find that her Great-Grandpa's Barnet and Harry were born in the SuwaÅ‚ki area of what was then part of Russia, an area now part of Poland with a portion of its historical area in Lithuania.  So what is SuwaÅ‚ki?  Here is an expose on an area where I have roots.</p>

  <h1>Star Wars - The Whole Shebang So Far</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">August 23, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">For the past seven weekends, I have been watching all the main Star Wars films, from the classic trilogy to the newer prequels, some of which I hadn't seen before, all in Episode order, culminating in the new Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens.  As a kid, I enjoyed the classic Star Wars films, and saw Episode I, which I didn't care for, effectively turning me off of Episode II and III.  Older and wiser, and with a new movie out, I owed it to myself to see the entire series so far from beginning to current.  Without giving away any major plot spoilers that aren't clearly well-known: ("I am your Father," anyone?), here are my thoughts on all seven films.</p>
