<p>Does everyone know the song 'I Fought the Law,' with the famous lyrics, 'I fought the law, and the law won?' Good, it will help you get a better understand why Ammon Bundy and his terrorist militiamen friends will face a harsh reality now that they have been arrested for taking over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. After three weeks holding the place hostage, threatening to shoot law enforcement should they try to take them out, and leaving the people of Harney county scared, Ammon Bundy and his goons were finally arrested after 8 of them left to to attend a town meeting in the town of John Day.</p>

	<h4>A vision of what Ammon Bundy's life will be like, on a donut!</h4>
</div>

<p>The old adage of 'follow the law' held up when the FBI stopped them dead in their tracks.  Of course, most of these men, callously breaking the law by holding a federal building hostage, once they were caught, took the p***y way out and complied with the officers (the exact opposite response they threatened to take).  So much for being willing to die.  One member, the spokesmen of the group, LaVoy Finicum, held true to his word of rather being killed than going to jail, as he charged an officer and pulled out a gun before being shot and killed.  Ryan Bundy, the weird looking brother, got a minor wound for not initially complying.  Otherwise, it was a clean arrest.  The group and family members, might claim murder, but if you don't listen to the police and try to shoot, you will get shot back.  Now that Ammon Bundy and his dumb friends are charged with a felony, sitting in the Multnomah County prison in Portland, some seven hours and seemingly half the world away, now that they have complied with the law, they are in for a rude awakening.</p>

<p>For starters, being charged with a feline you leads to longer prison sentences than a simple misdemeanor.  That means they will spend at least a year in prison.  They could take a plea deal perhaps but as it is, they face up to ten years in prison.  It's clear the men are guilty.  They not only were seen at the Refuge, they frequently posted images, blogs, videos and other things on social media discussing their demands, plans, and ask for support and supplies (the fact that one person sent a bunch of sex toys is not only hilarious but fitting for a group of people at a place they don't belong receive something they don't want or need).  Fortunately for these ingrates, they will get to be in federal prisons, which are much nicer than state prisons.</p>

<p>As they are considered flight-risks, none of these goons will be able to get out of prison until their sentences are finished (at the moment).  As out-of-state individuals with no ties to Oregon whatsoever, they are untrustworthy and likely to flee.  When fighting the government and the legal system, they have the right to do so as they see fit, just like they have the right to protect land as they see fit.  Of course, people like these moronic militiamen think the government should have no rights, but they do.</p>

	<h4>Ryan Bundy: One picture happy, one picture upset.  Can you tell which one is which?</h4>
</div>

<p>Another obvious repercussion is that Ammon Bundy and friends, who waved their second amendment rights in everyone's faces as if they were patriotic for using them to protect themselves, and threaten those who tried to take their false rights away as lawbreakers, will no longer have that right.  As convicted felons, Ammon Bundy and friends lose their privilege to own guns, as convicted felons don't have that right.  That probably won't stop any of them from illegally owning a gun, as at least one of the members was already a convicted felon, but they'll have a tougher, (albeit way too easy) of a time getting their precious guns.  Given their criminal ways and delusional thoughts, they aren't likely to obey the federal government telling them they can't own guns.  After all, second amendment fanatics think everyone has the right, even though criminals don't.  And believe me, these men are criminals.  Look at the affidavit against these scumbags, this was well planned out.</p>

<p>If any of these men want to find employment, they would have a hard time getting a job, having to disclose their convictions.  Of course, as ranch owners, that won't be an issue, but people are less likely to support them, as they know who they are.  Only anti-government fanatics would want to do business with them.  They're being mocked and ridiculed online, so anyone following the story will recognize them and taunt them for thinking they're Patriots.  They're not.  They're anti-government terrorists.</p>

<p>Being in Portland is a lot different than being in Burns, Oregon.  Ammon Bundy and friends won't get any chance to visit, as he'll spend all of his time behind bars.  If Ammon wants to visit after he's released from prison, he should take a chance to visit Multnomah Falls and be amazed by its natural beauty.  One thing he would need to keep in mind is that it remains a beauty because the Government owns the land so no one will tarnish its beauty.  Another thing lost amongst these scoundrels.  There are some things worth protecting, and those who wish to tarnish its value for a buck need to learn the government has a right to protect its interest.  It's a lesson Bundy's dad, famed anti-government tax-cheat Cliven Bundy needs to face.  Had the government taken care of him and his law-breaking ways, this mess in Harney County might've been avoided.  But as of now, Ammon Bundy can enjoy his likeness mocking him on a donut.  Isn't that the real American Dream?</p>
