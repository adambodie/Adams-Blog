<p>The Republican party used to be a fair party. I may have never liked them enough to vote for any of their past presidential candidates, it's become increasingly clear the Republican party has jumped off the deep end and completely lost it sense of reality. Gone are the days of true leadership, instead we have a bunch of crybaby lawless imbeciles who go completely out of their way to obstruct the government process and spend their time doing nothing but complaining until they get their way. Maybe one of these days, they will realize their constant complaining is hurting their party, but until then, they have nothing to show for it and never will.</p>

	<h4>Jeb Bush might have been successful in the past, but now Republicans see him as a loser.</h4>
</div>

<p>Case in point is the LVP (least valuable player) of the 2016 campaign, Jeb Bush.  Bush entered the race as the most likely candidate for the Republicans, with millions upon millions of dollars attached to his campaign.  He seemed likable enough, had a sense of how to win the votes of the people whose votes were most needed, and had experience, but the one problem he faced was that he was part of the Bush family.  After all, his brother screwed things up in our country; tax breaks for the wealthy plus two unfunded wars equaling a massive economic collapse and billions in debt.  Yet while the Republicans of the past would have preferred him, even as recently as the last election, the Republicans today have completely thrown all logic out the window, instead going for pure ideology, constant complaining, and a ridiculous idea that their way is the only way to go and any other way is a complete catastrophe.  Even worse, their memory span only dates back to January 21, 2009, the day Obama became President, oblivious and forgetful of all the bad things that happened before hand.  So of course Republicans, angry having someone like Obama as President for eight years would bring the worse kind of people out there, the people who like those who cry and complain the most.</p>

<p>Today, Republicans only want what's acceptable to their principles.  They refuse to work with anyone that doesn't believe in their principles and they could care less about how they actually accomplished things in the past.  With all that given, Republicans, believing their government has failed them for not even trying to fight a losing battle where they are clearly outnumbered, have taken a liking to someone with no political experience whatsoever, a former Democrat who simply tells them what they want to hear; Donald Trump.  None of his past matters, the failed marriages, the failed businesses, the failed lawsuits.  Instead, they see someone who expresses their negative feelings, no matter how harsh and racist they are, rather than someone like Jeb Bush, who despite being more dorky and unlikeable than his brother and dad, acted more Presidential and more electable.</p>

<p>A smart Republican, knowing the demographics have changed, would try to make an effort with the minorities.  Donald Trump, on the other hand, has essentially blamed the minorities for all our nations problems.  The perfect grab for a person with racist tendencies who prefers things to be 'as white as possible'.  George W. Bush won two Presidential elections by gathering 40% of the Hispanic vote, a high number compared to John McCain and Mitt Romney during their campaigns against Obama.  Donald Trump, meanwhile, calls them rapists, murderers and drug dealers.  Yet Donald Trump's only reasoning that he would ever get their vote is because 'Hispanics like me.'  Chances are, they don't like Donald Trump, not even remotely.  Where Mitt Romney lacked the emotional plight of the Hispanic population, Donald Trump openly spits on their faces.  How do you win from that?</p>

	<h4>Donald Trump has run a campaign of negativity, name calling and racist banter.  Yet people like that.</h4>
</div>

<p>The Republicans of yesterday, though extreme in their views, were at least able to get something done.  Those days are gone.  Now we have a Senator like Ted Cruz, whom absolutely no one in the Senate even likes.  Yet the voters of today like that, because Ted Cruz wants what they want, and demands it or else, they threaten that things will go to hell.  They don't understand to be a successful congressman or congresswoman, you actually have to work with people to get things done.  Ted Cruz, on the other hand, is only in it for himself, to raise his profile, and yet his supporters like him for being 'pure' with his beliefs.  Never mind the constant lying, obstructionist attitude and accomplishing absolutely nothing during his short time as a Senator, Ted Cruz lives to object to everything the Democrats support, even voting against a bill he initially supported because the Democrats actually supported it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a candidate like John Kasich, a pure conservative when he ran for President in 2000, became the moderate candidate in this election.  Kasich shares little in common with the Democrats, yet the notion that he went against the grain to expand Medicare as Governor of Ohio, when most Republican governors refused out of their hatred of Obamacare and all things Obama, which Kasich did because he felt it was the right thing to do, makes him appear moderate for compromising.  Senate lead majority Mitch McConnell, who infamously stated his goal was to make Obama a one-term President, is now casted by the extremist right as 'not conservative enough,' even though there's nothing moderate about him.  Yet Republicans today think McConnell and former Speaker of the House John Boehner didn't do enough to fight for their needs.  Ignoring the simple fact that the Democrats were in control and they were outnumbered, Republicans today expect that they will always win, even when outnumbered, as if the Elections of 2008 and 2012 never happened.  They don't care about anyone who's not Conservative, blasting Democrats as un-American and not one of them.</p>

<p>The biggest factor in the Republicans rise of hatred is of course, their racist hatred of Obama, whom they blame for everything that's wrong.  They treat him like a Muslim even though he isn't a Muslim, simply because he has a Muslim name and doesn't share the same beliefs as them, as if he's not truly American.  Somehow, they think he has all the control, even though Congress is in charge of producing and passing bills, which they are clearly incapable of doing.  They act like the Constitution must be followed, and accuse Obama of not following the Constitution, even though they like to ignore parts of the Constitution that leave them at a disadvantage, i.e., the equal rights protection that allows gays to get married, and the sudden invention of a clause that a President can't nominate a Supreme Court Justice in the last year of office, a clause which doesn't exist.  It doesn't matter what happened on January 20, 2009, or the months beforehand for Republicans.  They forget how bad things were.  Yet they think since January 21, 2009 that things have gone completely south.</p>

	<h4>Ted Cruz has accomplished nothing yet people like him for what he believes in.</h4>
</div>


<p>Since Republicans tend to think with little complexity, here is how they think of terms of good vs. bad events.  Everything bad during Obama's Presidency is his fault, anything good is because of something George W. Bush did beforehand.  Everything bad that happened during Bush's Presidency is either a. Bill Clinton's fault beforehand, or b. The Democrat controlled Senate and House's fault.  They'd never suggest all the good things that happened during the Reagan era was because of Jimmy Carter of the Democratic controlled Senate and House, yet they have no problem blaming everything on the Democrats these days.</p>

<p>The Democrats had a similar problem in the 1970's and 1980's, voting more pure candidates, yet losing elections to the crooked and corrupt Richard Nixon, but they eventually figured out they needed more electable candidates, voting for a more centrist Bill Clinton.  But while Democrats are more acceptable to change, Republicans are stubborn and expect things to stay the same.  Whether they actually come to terms with this remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: Republicans aren't going to accomplish anything when they keep trying the same exclusionary tricks they always have in a time where the very people they exclude are the ones who are gaining the power.  And that is what the white, old Republican Party hates the most.</p>
