<p>Back in December, a horrific attack occurred in San Bernardino from a husband and wife who supported ISIS. They were killed in a shootout, but yet another battle has raged. The FBI wants all the information on Syed Farook’s iPhone, but as it was encrypted with a password, they can’t get into it, for Apple’s security features erases the phone's data after 10 failed password attempts. Despite a Federal judge demanding Apple create a way to hack into the phone, Apple refuses to do so, believing everyone’s iPhone is at risk by creating such a back-door. Should Apple be forced to comply? Or is it better not to play with fire?</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>Apple, fighting for our right to privacy.</h4>
</div>

<p>The police have a right to know what’s in Farook’s phone, it could help stop more attacks.  That much is clear.  But is it worth it to create something that could cause more harm than good in the long run just to get information that could exist?  That to me is the larger question at hand.  Tech giants, like Apple and Google, have every right to be concerned about the implications creating a back-door has on the larger population.  After all, our society has become so technology dependent that basically everyone has and uses something that contain our data.  Whether it’s iPhones, laptops or desktops, our information is out there for someone to grab.  That's why we have privacy settings, just like we do with our homes.  But unlike homes, with keys to lock a house to keep people out, technology is for the most part, has the same security.  Make a key, and it can be used on everybody.  I own an iPhone, yet it’s not unique.  They’ve made millions of iPhones that look and act just like mine.  Making code that would allow access to my iPhone can be used on every other iPhone just like mine as well.</p>

<p>The bigger question to me is, can the government be trusted with technology that can hack into anyone’s phone?  Clearly, the government can’t be trusted in this department.  For starters, they’ve been hacked into multiple times over the past few years.  That alone is an alarm of concern.  If such a technology existed, and people knew it existed, hackers all over the world would try anything to do to get their hands on it and exploit it.  Nothing will stop them from committing cons and hacking into people’s personal information.  Cybersecurity is a big concern, yet hardly anyone talks about it within the government.  Some people are more concerned with keeping foreigners out of our country than they are protecting people’s privacy in the country.  Until the Government proves it can be trusted to keep us safe, which they’ve failed time and time again, creating such a technology is a bad idea and would cause more harm than good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the government can only do so much to protect us.  After all, the best way to solve all of our unsolved crimes, whether it’s rape, murder or tracking fugitives would be to collect everyone's DNA, fingerprints and search every residence in America to have all the information needed on every American citizen.  Would it keep us safe if the Government had all of our information?  Sure, but is it constitutional to do so?  Not according to the Fourth Amendment.  We all have a right to privacy, and I wouldn’t want the Government to have my genetic information or barrage through my house if they have no reason to suspect I’ve done anything wrong, even in the name of safety.  The thought of that is frightening enough, and the same logic applies to my phone.  If the government had the ability to hack into someone’s phone, who knows what they would do in the name of safety.  They’ve already proven so with their metadata collection that they would do anything to get information in the name of safety, and although metadata is meaningless without the data itself, it creates a slippery slope of privacy versus safety.</p>

<p>At some point, law enforcement and the government will have to realize they can’t get all the information regarding their cases.  They won’t get all of the information on Syed Farook; after all, who knows what information he didn’t keep a trail on, his thoughts in his head.  There’s no proof he even had information on his phone, it’s only conjecture on the FBI’s behalf.  In a perfect world, there would be a way to only hack into a phone for legal reasons, but phones aren’t unique.  There are millions of iPhones out there with the same technology, and technology doesn’t discriminate based on the person using it.  So while law enforcement and congress can try to force Apple into believing future crimes could lead to blood on their hands, the truth is law enforcement and congress are equally to blame, and we can’t stop all crimes from happening.  The government can’t infringe on my rights and the rights of the majority of Americans just to stop the few bad ones from committing crimes.</p>
