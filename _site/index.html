  <h1>Super Bowl LI Preview</h1>

  <p class="intro">It's that time of year again.  Another NFL has come and gone, and there’s one game left, the granddaddy of them all, the Super Bowl.  This year, the Super Bowls being played in Houston, in a classic David vs. Goliath battle.  Clearly, the big bad Goliath is the New England Patriots, the most disliked team in the NFL, who always find ways to stay on top, even when they spy and deflate their way to victory.  On the flip side is the Atlanta Falcons, in just their second Super Bowl ever, who started the season with less super bowl bets than the god-awful Cleveland Browns (Editor’s Note:  I’m still open to take over as their  <strong><a href='http://blog.bodiewebdesign.com/blog/sports/football/2016/10/10/why-i-should-be-the-next-starting-quarterback-of-the-cleveland-browns'>starting quarterback</a></strong>).  Can the Atlanta Falcons do what no other team, minus the New York Giants (twice) did in the Super Bowl and beat the Patriots?  Or are we doomed to live in a hell hole of football agony that we’re already suffering in real life at the hands of evil Dictator Donald Trump?  Here are my thoughts.</p>

  <p class="intro">The regular season has come and gone.  Now it's time to see who makes it to the Super Bowl and win the big game.  Thirty-two teams entered the season with hopes at the title, but now only twelve remain.  Here are my thoughts on the season as it was and my Super Bowl predictions.</p>

  <p class="intro">It's been one hell of a ride this season, but on Monday, the National Championship will be played, a rematch of last season's National Championship between Alabama and Clemson.  The semi-finals were both duds competitive wise as Alabama and Clemson were clearly better than Washington and Ohio State, but if last year's game is any indication, this should be a great follow-up.</p>

  	<span class="date">January 3, 2017</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Just when it looked like the Gophers program was starting to build, the administration fired head coach Tracy Claeys.  Why?  Because during the player boycott, Tracy Claeys sent a tweet in support of the players.  Did he phrase his tweet correctly?  Perhaps he could've said things differently, something he admitted.  But Claeys did not deserve to get fired over this.  There's obviously a big mess between the players and the administration and Claeys should not have been made a scapegoat.  So what now?</p>

  <p class="intro">2016 is over, and it couldn't have ended any sooner.  2016 has been the year that the world has completely turned stupid.  Common sense and respect have been thrown out of the window in favor of hate and extremism.  But there's hope for those who feel like the world has lost its way.  For me, it's self-determination and aiming for the best.  Here's the second half of my year in review.</p>

  <p class="intro">2016 has come and gone, and although there are plenty of things wrong with the hip-hop culture, there are always going to be reasons to actually enjoy it.  Times have changed, and while popular rap is getting dumber and dumber by the moment, the good news is that there is hope.  Here are my thoughts on the year it was.</p>

  <p class="intro">2016 has been a big year for a**holes.  Certain people purposely act like a**holes to destroy the very fabric of society for their own personal gain.  Others act like a**holes sorely for the attention.  And of course, there are plenty of people who do stupid things and end up being a**sholes as a consequence.  Of course, in order to be an a**hole, you must be around to know that you're an a**shole.  Those who die being an a**hole don't qualify.  With that said, here is my list of biggest a**holes of the year.</p>

  <h1>Holiday Bowl Wrap-Up</h1>

  	<span class="date">December 28, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Entering the Holiday Bowl, all of the attention was on the Gophers and their pregame drama.  They were down 10 players, 4 in the secondary that were essential to stopping Washington State's Air Raid offense.  It seemed like all the cards were in Wazzu's favor.  But yet, there's a reason they actually play the game.  And there's also a reason that Wazzu and Mike Leach have never been conference contenders.  So what happened at the Holiday Bowl?</p>

  <p class="intro">Bowl season has begun, and Minnesota, sitting at 8-4, has one more chance to prove they're on the right direction.  But all that took a backseat early in the week when 10 players were suspended indefinitely for an alleged sexual assault that took place in September.  The rest of the team, upset with the decision, boycotted the decision and threatened to skip the Holiday Bowl unless the 10 players were reinstated.  The boycott lasted two days, and while they're still down 10 players, the message is still as confusing and complex as ever.  What exactly have we learned from all of this?</p>

  <h1>College Football Thoughts - Army Navy Special</h1>

  	<span class="date">December 10, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">The last official regular season game is always between Army and Navy, as Army entered the game with a 14 game losing streak against Navy dating back to 2001.  This year, Army has looked better than they have, entering the game above .500, which has happened only once in the past 20 years.  Navy entered the game limping at 9-3, with some key injuries and losing the Temple in the AAC championship game.  Would this be the year Army finally beats Navy?</p>
