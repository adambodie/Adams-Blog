  <h1>Hip-Hop 2016 - The Year it was</h1>

  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">December 31, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">2016 has come and gone, and although there are plenty of things wrong with the hip-hop culture, there are always going to be reasons to actually enjoy it.  Times have changed, and while popular rap is getting dumber and dumber by the moment, the good news is that there is hope.  Here are my thoughts on the year it was.</p>

  <h1>Biggest A**holes of 2016</h1>

  <p class="intro">2016 has been a big year for a**holes.  Certain people purposely act like a**holes to destroy the very fabric of society for their own personal gain.  Others act like a**holes sorely for the attention.  And of course, there are plenty of people who do stupid things and end up being a**sholes as a consequence.  Of course, in order to be an a**hole, you must be around to know that you're an a**shole.  Those who die being an a**hole don't qualify.  With that said, here is my list of biggest a**holes of the year.</p>

  <h1>Holiday Bowl Wrap-Up</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">December 28, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Entering the Holiday Bowl, all of the attention was on the Gophers and their pregame drama.  They were down 10 players, 4 in the secondary that were essential to stopping Washington State's Air Raid offense.  It seemed like all the cards were in Wazzu's favor.  But yet, there's a reason they actually play the game.  And there's also a reason that Wazzu and Mike Leach have never been conference contenders.  So what happened at the Holiday Bowl?</p>

  <h1>The Gophers are heading to the Holiday Bowl - Take Two</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">December 18, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Bowl season has begun, and Minnesota, sitting at 8-4, has one more chance to prove they're on the right direction.  But all that took a backseat early in the week when 10 players were suspended indefinitely for an alleged sexual assault that took place in September.  The rest of the team, upset with the decision, boycotted the decision and threatened to skip the Holiday Bowl unless the 10 players were reinstated.  The boycott lasted two days, and while they're still down 10 players, the message is still as confusing and complex as ever.  What exactly have we learned from all of this?</p>

  <h1>College Football Thoughts - Army Navy Special</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">December 10, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">The last official regular season game is always between Army and Navy, as Army entered the game with a 14 game losing streak against Navy dating back to 2001.  This year, Army has looked better than they have, entering the game above .500, which has happened only once in the past 20 years.  Navy entered the game limping at 9-3, with some key injuries and losing the Temple in the AAC championship game.  Would this be the year Army finally beats Navy?</p>

  <h1>What To Think Of Willie Taggart</h1>

  <p class="intro">The Oregon Ducks have a new football coach, as they announced the hiring of South Florida coach Willie Taggart to become the new coach.  The Ducks interviewed multiple candidates, but in the end, hired Taggart over Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen.  Did the Ducks make the right hire? Here are my thoughts on the new Ducks head coach.</p>

  <p class="intro">Today marked the announcement of all the colorful, albeit way too many, bowl games, most notably the College Football Playoff and New Year's Six games.  The Oregon Ducks weren't eligible, but the Gophers were, so I'll only have one game I need to watch.  Here are my thoughts on the more exciting bowls and playoffs.</p>

  <p class="intro">Championship Week is here, as most playoff contenders (sorry Ohio State) have one more chance to make that big statement they need to be in the final four.  Who wins, who loses, and who gets left home wishing that they hadn't lost that one game?  Here are my thoughts on the matter.</p>

  <h1>The Brand New Lakers</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 30, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">It's only the end of November, and already, the young new Lakers have proven that not only is the Kobe era over, but that they're much further ahead of schedule than anyone anticipated.  The young Lakers just won a close game in Chicago tonight, with a 10-10 record, already more than half the wins they had all of last year.  The Lakers have been the biggest surprise in the league this year and there are plenty of reasons to love these Lakers.</p>

  <h1>The End of the Rich Brooks Era</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">November 29, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">For as long as I’ve been a fan of the Oregon Ducks, which started with their 2001 Fiesta Bowl blowout against Colorado and blossomed when I went to school there for three years, I’ve always respected the football team’s family-styled approach to coaching.  Starting with Rich Brooks, who coached the Ducks from 1977 to 1994, when he brought the Ducks to respectability and a Rose Bowl appearance before departing for the NFL, the Ducks always had, for the most part, a close knit family tree of coaching, as the ‘Next Man Up’ mantra reigned supreme.  But that era has ended today as the Oregon Ducks fired Mark Helfrich as their head coach after a disappointing 4-8 season.  Whether he was the right coach or whether the Ducks will replace him with someone better remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure, the Ducks are now just another program looking to win.  So what happened?</p>
