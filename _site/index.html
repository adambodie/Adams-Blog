  <h1>Liar Liar, Pant is on Fire</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 26, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">People lie, doesn't matter who you are.  But some people lie more than others.  This year, lying has become the new truth-telling, as the Republican candidate for President, whose name won't be mentioned, lies about, well, basically everything.  This is coming from a man who believes it's okay to lie and does so repeatedly and often as possible.  A man so deluded in himself that he complains a mass conspiracy every time someone tells him what he's saying is lying.  He even claims Ted Cruz as the biggest liar of all time with the nickname Lyin' Ted (to be fair, they are both ridiculous liars). With that said, tonight is the first Presidential debate, and one thing is for certain: this Idiot will frequently lie.  If a drinking game would be made out of it, all participants would die of alcohol poisoning. Here's a live look at lie upon lie upon lie..</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Four Thoughts</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 25, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week Four is a reminder to most that non-conference games are over and the major part of the season begins.  For me, this week can be dubbed the 'State of Colorado' week, as Minnesota faced off against Colorado State, while Oregon hosted Colorado.  An interesting coincidence but nonetheless a good week of football.</p>

  <h1>Who Killed JonBenét?</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 24, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Twenty years ago, the night after Christmas, six year old JonBenét Ramsey was found murdered in her home, in what has become a bizarre and fascinating case, from the rambling ransom note to the suspicion on the family, there are many odd things about the case that makes it unusual.  Yet after 20 years, no one really knows what happened.  Recently, a new investigator team, with new technology, reanalyzed the evidence and discussed their findings on a CBS special.  So with that all said, who killed JonBenét Ramsey?  Here are all my possible theories, complete with their likelihood of it happening.</p>

  <h1>Skittles - A Poor Analogy to Describe Humanity</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 20, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Today, Donald Trump Jr., son of the racist bigot Idiot whom he's named after, again proved that racism is learned, much like his racist father and grandfather, by making this ridiculous analogy about Syrian refugees: "If I had a bowl of Skittles and I told you just three would kill you.  Would you take a handful?"  Aside from being moronic and overly simplistic, statements like this are a perfect example of why racial profiling is flat out wrong.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Three Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 17, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Week 3, unlike the week before, featured a lot of challenging match-ups, and for the first time ever, the Top 3 ranked teams in the AP poll play on the road against other ranked teams.  Alabama at Ole Miss, Florida State at Louisville and Ohio State at Oklahoma.  Safe to say, champions are made here.  Other plenty of entertaining games abound.  So what happened on Week 3?  Here are my thoughts.</p>

  <h1>Worst Politicians Currently in Office</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 15, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">Let's be honest, politics is dumb at its core and politicians are terrible.  Currently, Congress has an approval rating of about 10% or so.  Plenty of our current politicians couldn't figure their way out of a paper bag, much less pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation.  No matter who's elected President, Congress will always find ways to screw things up and stop real progress from happening.  With that said, here are the 15 worst members of Congress, and as an added bonus, the 5 worst Governors.</p>

  <h1>College Football Week Two Thoughts</h1>

  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 10, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On paper, Week Two looked to be the worst weekend of college football ever.  No ranked teams facing each other, more ranked teams playing FCS weaklings than fellow Power 5 teams, and just one ranked team on the road, #13 Louisville playing at Syracuse in an ACC Showdown.  But life has plenty of surprises, as Week 2 provided more entertainment than on paper.  Week 3 promises to be better in terms of quality matchups, but here are my thoughts on what happened in Week 2.</p>

  <h1>Nature Deserves Respect Too</h1>
	<div class="row">  
  <div class="col-md-6">
  <p class="author">
  	<span class="date">September 8, 2016</span></p>
  <p class="intro">On August 29th, a group of idiots, believing they can do whatever they want without any repercussions, destroyed a famous rock at Cape Kiwanda known as Duckbill.  Fortunately, someone recorded them committing the act and confronted them over it.  But the damage was done, all because some idiots couldn’t read a sign and blamed everyone but themselves for something that was obviously avoidable.  Too many people take nature for granted, and it deserves every bit of respect it gets.</p>

  <h1>NFL Preview</h1>

  <p class="intro">As further proof of the seasons changing, the NFL season is about to start, with a Thursday night rematch of Super Bowl 50, the Denver Broncos vs. the Carolina Panthers.  It should be an exciting year in the NFL, with a lot of notable events in the offseason and plenty of more on the way.  Which team will surprise this year?  Which team will disappoint this year?  Who wins the MVP?  Here's my thoughts on the NFL season on the horizon.</p>

  <p class="intro">Thank god football's back.  It's refreshing to take interest in something besides politics and this ridiculous election.  Week One is under wraps, and though only a handful of games carry any value, it's only the beginning.  Here's my thoughts.</p>
