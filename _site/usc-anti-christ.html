<p>Today marks another edition of Oregon vs. USC.  This should be just another game.  But for me, I consider myself the unofficial President of the 'I Hate USC' Club, perhaps just the President of the Portland Chapter of the 'I Hate USC' Club.  It shouldn't have to be this way, but yet I passionately hate USC more than any football program in college sports.  Not schools like Oregon State and Washington, nor schools like Wisconsin, Iowa, and Michigan, rival schools of Oregon (where I started) and Minnesota (where I graduated).  But yet, it's USC that makes me puke the most.  With apologies to my Uncle Fred and cousin Kimmy, two USC graduates who actually show me love and respect (even from afar), here's a time-line of my hatred for USC.</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>Vernon Adams: Former USC fan turned USC killer</h4>
</div>

<p>Growing up, I didn't think much of USC.  Their football team was irrelevant through the 1990's, with the John Robinson and Paul Hackett eras bringing nothing to the table.  Then in 2001, came along a coach no one initially thought would bring anything to the table, Pete Carroll.  After all, a mediocre NFL coach beforehand couldn't possible do much, right?  Wrong.  USC rose to the top under his leadership.  Not surprisingly, when your team does well, its fans become more rabid and arrogant.</p>
<p>Enter my Uncle Hooter, who started to become quite obsessive with his love for all things USC football.  USC colored everything?  Check!  USC colored game room? Check!  USC fight song doorbell?  The whole thing became sickening.  And throughout this time, my Uncle Hooter always took the opportunity to bash me for going to the University of Oregon.  Never one to show respect, I might have let it slide if not for two things.  First, USC ruled the conference and acted as if they were alone at the top.  It was always 'USC and the Nine Dwarfs.'  Enough to make the remaining members of the conference sick of USC.  Two, I was always reminded of this by Hooter's constant wearing of all things USC colors.  My other Uncle gave me a hard time too because he was an Oregon State grad, but yet he didn't make everything about the Beavers, nor did he always wear Beaver colors.</p>
<p>The USC impenetrable armor started to crack in 2005, at the 2006 Rose Bowl for the National Championship against Texas.  Have mythically won two straight National Championships, the build-up to the game was ridiculous.  Sports networks like ESPN had already crowned them the National Champion, comparing them to previous title winners over the years.  There was one problem with that though, USC hadn't yet played the game.  Enter Vince Young, the dazzling Texas Quarterback who almost single-handedly beat the USC Trojans and dethroned them.  I guess USC wasn't nearly as good as those all time greats, because they won national championships, USC did not.  Between 2006 and 2009, USC continued to show their arrogance and perceived entitlement, often playing down their opponents.  USC didn't make it back to the National Championship during any of those years, as one Pac-10 team would beat USC in a game USC would have won if they had actually taken them seriously.  This was best exemplified in 2007, when USC, a 42 point favorite against Stanford, lost at the last minute, all the while Stanford, the worst team in the conference at the time, was down to its backup quarterback.  Yet Uncle Hooter would still assume his precious team was the best and downplayed every accomplish every other team had, ignoring the obvious.</p>

<div class="blog-pic" style="float: left">

	<h4>The recruiting tide started to tilt when De'Anthony Thomas went from USC to Oregon.</h4>
</div>

<p>Eventually, USC's dirty little secret came out: Reggie Bush, their electrifying Heisman winner of 2005, broke multiple rules by accepting money from a wannabe agent.  And in typical USC arrogance, the school refused to cooperate with the NCAA once they found out.  Obviously, USC knew of what Bush was doing (how couldn't they?) and wanted it to go away.  It eventually grew to their basketball team.  It took years to come to a ruling, but in 2010 USC became the first team to forfeit a National Championship.  Reggie Bush became the first player ever to forfeit a Heisman Trophy, and multiple sanctions were handed down.  Coincidentally (though most people don't think it was), Pete Carroll went back to the NFL, becoming the coach of the Seattle Seahawks.</p>

<p>With Pete Carroll out of the picture and heavy sanctions in place, USC fans like my Uncle Hooter became more focused on glorifying the past rather than the present.  Gone were the days of celebrating their recent success of their oldest rival, Notre Dame, which I learned as I bought a Notre Dame shirt and wore it to Rosh Hashanah just to piss him off.  No more days of encouraging his kids to stop trying to beat me at video games, turning off the game because they were losing and celebrating their current success of the time.  It was the only way for Uncle Hooter to stay ahead, as Oregon became the top team in the Conference, not to mention more nationally relevant and popular than USC.</p>

<p>Their football team was much of the same.  They relied on the past with hopes it would help their present and future.  This was accomplished by hiring Pete Carroll's former assistants to coach the team.  First came Lane Kiffin, who briefly coached the Oakland Raiders, before being fired publicly by then-Owner Al Davis, before coaching the Tennessee Volunteers for one year, racking up more NCAA violations than wins.  Lane Kiffin, a bumbling idiot who considered minor violations a great recruiting tool, had limited scholarships due to their probation and was Bowl-ineligible for his first two seasons.  They got lucky in 2011 to beat Oregon, the top team in the conference.  Sadly, this was one of the biggest highlights of the Hooter's year, as they would criticize Oregon for every loss they got (obviously because they had nothing to be proud of for their team while they were bowl ineligible).</p>

<div class="blog-pic">

	<h4>USC should consider themselves lucky they only had to face Marcus Mariota once.</h4>
</div>

<p>Now USC is consistently over-ranked because they are USC.  Never mind their poor coaching, or overrated players who never pan out like they should.  This was true in 2012, when USC began the season ranked #1.  USC finished that year 7-6, free falling to become the worst Preseason #1 ranked team ever.  By the time the Sun Bowl came, USC clearly didn't want any part of the game, losing to Georgia Tech 21-7, a team that needed a waiver just to play in the game.  The most shocking thing was the Lane Kiffin kept his job until midway through the following season.  Their next coach they hired: another former Pete Carroll assistant, Steve Sarkisian, who brought the Washington Huskies out of the ashes of a 6-6 team to the great levels of a 7-5 team.  Though Steve Sarkisian appeared to be an upgrade from Lane Kiffin, hard to believe he was even worse, and lasted even less.</p>

<p>Sarkisian lasted one full year with USC, finishing as an average 8-5 team losing close games they probably should have won. Despite this, USC was again ranked as the best team in the conference entering this current season.  Not surprisingly USC was over-ranked and looked unimpressive to start the season.  Meanwhile, Steve Sarkisian's life was spiraling out of control, with an alcohol addiction taking control of his life.  Sarkisian was fired midway through the season, after appearing drunk at a meeting.  USC did the right thing by making him go to rehab, but screwed that up by firing him the next day.</p><p>So as I watched Oregon beat the crap out of USC, 48-28, I am reminded how much I truly hate USC.  But as I celebrated my birthday at the Grand Canyon, my Uncle Hooter, whom I don't talk to anymore, couldn't say anything nice to me or acknowledge my birthday.  Instead, all he could do was mock me for my Oregon hat, with the only argument being that Oregon lost the national championship game.  Typical arrogance of a USC fan.  They have nothing to cheer, so they talk down their opponents like Oregon because they have been far more successful as of recent than USC. It's the only reason people like my Uncle Hooter only appreciate the past.  And as I finally gave it to him, reminding him of their cheating, all Uncle Hooter could do was deny it meant anything.  Winning dishonestly is not a good thing, yet USC fans still deny they did anything wrong and believe they were unfairly targeted.</p>

<p>There's a reason people like me hate USC with a passion.  People like my Uncle Hooter, whom I have no relationship with, always have an inflated ego when it comes to their teams.  They look down at teams like Minnesota (suggesting that any win they get is against subpar opponents).  They believe their team can beat anyone (even though they lost multiple games in a year, that's why Oregon made the National Championship in 2010, they won all their regular season games).  They'll flaunt their legacy (here's looking at you O.J. Simpson, oh wait, his claim to fame was the 'Trial of the Century,' who cares about his football or acting career) and their celebrity fans (Will 'Why does anyone think I'm funny anymore' Ferrell, or Snoop 'My son's a UCLA Bruin' Dogg come to mind).  They love their past, because their present is bad now (I graduated at Minnesota, who has won seven National Championship, but hasn't won a conference title since 1967, doesn't really help now).  There's a reason USC is suddenly setting single game records for most points given up, most yards given up, most touchdown passes given (the latter just set today by Vernon Adams with a 6 touchdown performance).  And it's not because USC is elite.</p>

<p>So here's my cheers to the USC Trojans and all their obnoxious fans.  Enjoy wishing it was still 2004 USC fans, because the game has gotten faster and USC has gotten slower.  And without the ability to cheat up their sleeves, USC is stuck looking at second place.  There's a reason Steve Sarkisian complained about Oregon jerseys.  There's also a reason of persistent and unrealistic rumors of Chip Kelly taking over the team.  Because the time is now and USC is stuck in reverse.</p>
