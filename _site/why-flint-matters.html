<p>A few months ago, while campaigning for President, Donald Trump, known for stupid comments, remarked that President Obama made his stupidest remark ever when he declared 'global warming' our number one enemy.  Donald Trump, wanting to scare people into thinking everyone is going to be attacked by a foreigner any second now, wants to diminish global warming because his party doesn't believe in it.  This of course is the same man who believes the Chinese created global warming to gain a financial edge.  But with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, people should be more aware of global warming and the effect the environment in general has on our society.</p>

	<h4>The Flint River, looks innocent, but quite deadly.</h4>
</div>

<p>Yes, it's true that terrorist attacks are bad, they kill people who don't deserve it, and they deserve to be punished.  But overlooking the global warming and environmental issues we face is more of a threat than terrorists.  Reason being, it affects everyone.  Nature doesn't discriminate.  It doesn't listen to reason.  It does whatever the situation provides.  Case in point, the water crisis in Flint.  In 2014, the Michigan state officials, determined to cut costs, temporarily used the Flint River as its water source, rather than Lake Huron, where they had been getting its water from.  They did so despite the fact that the Flint River was known to be disgusting.  They overlooked the environmental concerns by putting money first, and voila, they brought water with dangerously high levels of lead into every household in Flint, Michigan.  They eventually switched back to Lake Huron, but the damage was done.</p>

<p>Almost two years later, a full-blown crisis has developed in Flint.  It's unsafe to drink the tap water, and unsafe to bathe or shower in it.  Imagine living in a place where its water, which can be found everywhere, is dangerous and toxic.  Everyone needs water, to drink, to clean, to bathe, etc.  Yet Michigan state officials have slowly responded to an issue two years in the making, claiming it wasn't a concern, yet people knew their water looked, smelled and tasted bad.  They overlooked the high levels of lead, which never leaves your body once it enters it.  And despite switching water sources, it remains in all of its piping system, which is expensive to replace in a city of 100,000+ people.</p>

<p>The city has spent much of its time using water filters for trying to get rid of the toxic lead in the tap water, and bringing in lots of bottled water for those to drink.  Yet this problem was preventable, as spending a few extra bucks could have either kept the water source at Lake Huron, or use an anti-corrosion agent that would have cleaned the Flint River's water for $100 a day.  In an age where some politicians, like the Republican Governor of Michigan Rick Snyder, want to spend more money on the military fighting bogus wars than they do protecting the environment for those who live in the country, one must ask themselves, which is really worse, a terrorist attack or a city wide attack on water?</p>

<p>The fact that it's taken two years to do anything major about it shows a lack of care for the environment.  With some people more concerned about cutting costs and building up our military to fight terrorists, clearly their priorities are in the wrong place.  9/11 killed 3,000 people, wounded many more, and frightened most Americans, yet living in a place where even the most ubiquitous thing available (water) is causing harm to everyone that comes in contact with it has more of an immediate effect on those around it.  This can happen anywhere, anytime without warning, and truth be told, natural elements have way more of an effect than 'foreigners.'  So while Donald Trump can claim the environment isn't worth protecting and global warming is a scam, would he or anyone like it living in Beijing, where the air is unbreathable most of the time, and people can only feel completely safe inside their home?  The rich money making man who only wants to profit doesn't care, but the majority of people need these basic elements to survive and not get sick.</p>
